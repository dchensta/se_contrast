"During his fifth semester of medical school, Jacob Henle, an anatomist who had published a theory of contagion in 1840, asked him to participate in his research project on uterine nerve structure.",asked,Henle,DYNAMIC
"In his sixth semester, Koch began to conduct research at the Physiological Institute,",began,Koch,DYNAMIC

==Research contributions==,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
===Anthrax===,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Robert Koch is widely known for his work with anthrax, discovering the causative agent of the fatal disease to be Bacillus anthracis.",known,contributions,STATIVE
Koch discovered the formation in anthrax bacteria of spores,discovered,Koch,DYNAMIC
that could remain dormant under specific conditions.,remain,spores,STATIVE
"However, under optimal conditions, the spores were activated and caused disease.",activated,spores,DYNAMIC
"To determine this causative agent,",determine,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"he dry-fixed bacterial cultures onto glass slides,",dry-fixed,he,DYNAMIC
"used dyes to stain the cultures,",used,he,DYNAMIC
and observed them through a microscope.,observed,he,DYNAMIC
Kochs work with anthrax is notable,is,work,STATIVE
"in that he was the first to link a specific microorganism with a specific disease,",was,rejecting,STATIVE
rejecting the idea of spontaneous generation,rejecting,first,DYNAMIC
and supporting the germ theory of disease.,supporting,first,DYNAMIC
===Koch's four postulates===,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Koch accepted a position as government advisor with the Imperial Department of Health in 1880.,accepted,Koch,DYNAMIC
"During his time as government advisor, he published a report",published,he,DYNAMIC
in which he stated the importance of pure cultures in isolating disease-causing organisms,stated,he,DYNAMIC
"and explained the necessary steps to obtain these cultures, methods",explained,he,DYNAMIC
which are summarized in Kochs four postulates.,summarized,methods,STATIVE
Kochs discovery of the causative agent of anthrax led to the formation of a generic set of postulates,led,discovery,DYNAMIC
which can be used in the determination of the cause of any infectious disease.,used,set,DYNAMIC
"These postulates, which not only outlined a method for linking cause and effect of an infectious disease",outlined,postulates,DYNAMIC
"but also established the significance of laboratory culture of infectious agents,",established,postulates,DYNAMIC
are listed here:,listed,postulates,STATIVE
"1. The organism must always be present, in every case of the disease.",be,organism,STATIVE
2. The organism must be isolated from a host,isolated,organism,DYNAMIC
containing the disease,containing,host,STATIVE
and grown in pure culture.,grown,organism,DYNAMIC
3. Samples of the organism taken from pure culture must cause the same disease,cause,Samples,DYNAMIC
"when inoculated into a healthy, susceptible animal in the laboratory.",inoculated,,DYNAMIC
4. The organism must be isolated from the inoculated animal,be,organism,DYNAMIC
and must be identified as the same original organism,identified,organism,DYNAMIC
first isolated from the originally diseased host.,isolated,organism,DYNAMIC
===Isolating pure culture on solid media===,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Koch began conducting research on microorganisms in a laboratory,began,Isolating,DYNAMIC
connected to his patient examination room.,connected,laboratory,STATIVE
"Kochs early research in this laboratory proved to yield one of his major contributions to the field of microbiology,",proved,research,DYNAMIC
as it was there,was,it,STATIVE
that he developed the technique,developed,he,DYNAMIC
of growing bacteria.,growing,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Koch's second postulate calls for the isolation and growth of a selected pathogen in pure laboratory culture.,calls,postulate,DYNAMIC
"In an attempt to grow bacteria, Koch began to use solid nutrients such as potato slices.",began,Koch,DYNAMIC
"Through these initial experiments, Koch observed individual colonies of identical, pure cells.",observed,Koch,DYNAMIC
Coming to the conclusion,Coming,Koch,DYNAMIC
"that potato slices were not suitable media for all organisms, Koch later began to use nutrient solutions with gelatin.",began,Koch,DYNAMIC
"However, he soon realized",realized,he,DYNAMIC
"that gelatin, like potato slices, was not the optimal medium for bacterial growth,",was,gelatin,STATIVE
"as it did not remain solid at 37C, the ideal temperature for growth of most human pathogens.",remain,it,STATIVE
"As suggested to him by Walther and Angelina Hesse, Koch began to utilize agar to grow and isolate pure cultures,",began,Koch,DYNAMIC
"as this polysaccharide remains solid at 37C,",remains,polysaccharide,STATIVE
"is not degraded by most bacteria,",degraded,polysaccharide,DYNAMIC
and results in a transparent medium.,results,polysaccharide,DYNAMIC
