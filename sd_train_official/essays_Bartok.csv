"To begin with,",begin,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"the opening motive in the celli and basses, shown in Example 3, outlines a pentatonic set",outlines,motive,DYNAMIC
and strongly presents C as the tonal center.,presents,motive,DYNAMIC

and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive.,is,importance,STATIVE
"Furthermore, the following two instances of this opening motive, shown in Examples 4 and 5, remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth,",remove,instances,DYNAMIC

"and adds pitch-class E to the pentatonic set of Example 3, creating a six-note set of stacked fourths.",adds,measures,DYNAMIC
Example 5 shows,shows,Example,DYNAMIC
the true dominance of the perfect fourth; the set created is a ten-note set,is,set,STATIVE

If we begin from the final D,begin,we,DYNAMIC
and ascend the circle of fourths,ascend,we,DYNAMIC

"Each note is either approached or left (or both) by a fourth,",approached,note,DYNAMIC
and the structural motion is from F to D.,is,note,STATIVE
"The overall motion in the first 29 measures is C to D, through F;",is,motion,STATIVE
"these are represented enharmonically in Example 2 as D, E and G.",represented,these,STATIVE
"As previously mentioned, this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole-tone descent from F to F.",constitutes,motion,STATIVE
So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step,is,whole,STATIVE
and the prevailing melodic motion is a (usually ascending) perfect fourth.,is,motion,STATIVE
We can connect the two by noting,connect,We,DYNAMIC
that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths;,consists,step,STATIVE
"indeed, the structural whole-tone descent is often filled in with the intervening fourth.",filled,descent,DYNAMIC
This motion is exemplified in Example 2 in the second theme group (mm.,exemplified,motion,DYNAMIC
"155-233), and as we will see,",see,we,DYNAMIC
"it occurs in other places, though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 2.",occurs,it,DYNAMIC
"Each time the motion in Examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths, the same sequence of intervals occurs: two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second",occurs,motion,DYNAMIC
"(-5, +2, -5); each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples.",bracketed,instance,STATIVE
This sequence of intervals is the inversion of those,is,sequence,STATIVE
