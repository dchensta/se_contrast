==Dualist solutions to the mindbody problem==,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Dualism is a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter (or body).,is,solutions,STATIVE

(mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE

===Arguments for dualism===,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The most frequently used argument in favour of dualism is that it appeals to the common-sense intuition,is,Arguments,STATIVE

If asked,asked,,DYNAMIC

"the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity.",respond,person,DYNAMIC
They would almost certainly deny,deny,They,DYNAMIC
"that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa,",is,mind,STATIVE
finding the idea,finding,brain,STATIVE
"that there is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible.",is,entity,STATIVE
Many modern philosophers of mind think,think,philosophers,STATIVE
that these intuitions are misleading,misleading,intuitions,STATIVE
"and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine",use,intuitions,DYNAMIC
whether there is any real basis to them.,is,basis,STATIVE
"Another important argument in favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties.",is,argument,STATIVE

or what nice music sounds like to a person.,sounds,sky,STATIVE
"But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask",is,it,STATIVE

There is something,is,something,STATIVE
"that it is like to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on.",is,it,STATIVE
There are qualia involved in these mental events,are,qualia,STATIVE
that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical.,seem,events,STATIVE
If consciousness (the mind) can exist independently of physical reality,exist,consciousness,STATIVE
"(the brain), one must explain",explain,one,DYNAMIC
how physical memories are created concerning consciousness.,created,memories,DYNAMIC
