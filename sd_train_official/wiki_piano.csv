The piano (an abbreviation of pianoforte),,,CANNOT_DECIDE
is a musical instrument,is,piano,STATIVE
played using a keyboard.,played,instrument,DYNAMIC
"It is widely used in classical and jazz music for solo performances, ensemble use, chamber music, accompaniment, and for composing and rehearsal.",used,It,DYNAMIC
"Although the piano is not portable and often expensive, its versatility and ubiquity have made it one of the world's most familiar musical instruments.",made,ubiquity,DYNAMIC
An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case,has,piano,STATIVE
"surrounding the soundboard and metal strings, and a row of 88 black and white keys (52 white, 36 black).",surrounding,case,STATIVE

"When the key is released, a damper stops the strings' vibration,",stops,damper,DYNAMIC
ending the sound.,ending,damper,DYNAMIC
"Although an acoustic piano has strings,",has,piano,STATIVE
it is usually classified as a percussion instrument,classified,it,DYNAMIC
because the strings are struck rather than plucked (as with a harpsichord or spinet);,struck,strings,DYNAMIC

"The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate ""soft"" and ""strong"" respectively,",indicate,piano,STATIVE
in this context referring to the variations in sound volume,referring,context,STATIVE
"the instrument produces in response to a pianist's touch on the keys: the greater the velocity of a key press, the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings, and the louder the sound of the note",produces,instrument,DYNAMIC

==History==,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The piano was founded on earlier technological innovations.,founded,piano,DYNAMIC
The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers.,were,instruments,STATIVE
"During the Middle Ages, there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings.",were,attempts,STATIVE
"By the 17th century, the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well known.",known,mechanisms,STATIVE
"In a clavichord, the strings are struck by tangents,",struck,strings,DYNAMIC
while in a harpsichord they are plucked by quills.,plucked,they,DYNAMIC
"Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown the most effective ways to construct the case, soundboard, bridge, and keyboard for a mechanism",shown,Centuries,DYNAMIC

it was too quiet for large performances.,was,it,STATIVE
"The harpsichord produced a sufficiently loud sound,",produced,harpsichord,DYNAMIC

"The piano was probably formed as an attempt to combine loudness with control,",formed,piano,DYNAMIC
avoiding the trade-offs of available instruments.,avoiding,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Cristofori's great success was solving, with no prior example, the fundamental mechanical problem of piano design:",solving,success,STATIVE
"the hammer must strike the string,",strike,hammer,DYNAMIC
but not remain in contact with it,remain,hammer,STATIVE
(as a tangent remains in contact with a clavichord string) because this would damp the sound.,remains,tangent,DYNAMIC
"Moreover, the hammer must return to its rest position",return,hammer,DYNAMIC
"without bouncing violently,",bouncing,hammer,DYNAMIC
and it must be possible to repeat a note rapidly.,be,it,STATIVE
Cristofori's piano action was a model for the many approaches to piano actions,was,action,STATIVE
