and the white stripes and bellies are additions.,are,bellies,STATIVE
It is likely,is,It,STATIVE
that the stripes are caused by a combination of factors.,caused,stripes,DYNAMIC
"The stripes are typically vertical on the head, neck, forequarters, and main body, with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal.",vertical,stripes,STATIVE
A wide variety of hypotheses have been proposed to account for the evolution of the striking stripes of zebras.,proposed,variety,DYNAMIC
"The more traditional of these (1 and 2, below) relate to camouflage.",relate,traditional,STATIVE
1. The vertical striping may help the zebra hide in grass by disrupting its outline.,help,striping,DYNAMIC
"In addition, even at moderate distances, the striking striping merges to an apparent grey.",merges,striping,DYNAMIC
2. The stripes may help to confuse predators by motion,help,appear,DYNAMIC

4. Experiments by different researchers indicate,indicate,Experiments,STATIVE
"that the stripes are effective in attracting fewer flies,",are,stripes,STATIVE

that zebra-striped models were nearly minimally attractive to tabanid horseflies.,were,models,STATIVE
"These flies are attracted to linearly polarized light,",attracted,flies,STATIVE
and the study showed,showed,flies,DYNAMIC
that black and white stripes disrupt the attractive pattern.,disrupt,stripes,DYNAMIC
"Further, attractiveness increases with stripe width,",increases,attractiveness,DYNAMIC
