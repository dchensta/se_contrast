In 1850 Swan began working on a light bulb,began,=,DYNAMIC
using carbonised paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb.,using,bulb,DYNAMIC
"By 1860 he was able to demonstrate a working device,",was,he,STATIVE
and obtained a British patent,obtained,he,DYNAMIC
"covering a partial vacuum, carbon filament incandescent lamp.",covering,patent,STATIVE
"However, the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate electric source resulted in an inefficient bulb with a short lifetime.",resulted,source,DYNAMIC
In 1875 Swan returned to consider the problem of the light bulb with the aid of a better vacuum and a carbonised thread as a filament.,returned,Swan,DYNAMIC
"The most significant feature of Swan's improved lamp was that there was little residual oxygen in the vacuum tube to ignite the filament,",was,feature,STATIVE
thus allowing the filament to glow almost white-hot,allowing,,STATIVE
without catching fire.,catching,filament,DYNAMIC
"However, his filament had low resistance,",had,filament,STATIVE

Swan first publicly demonstrated his incandescent carbon lamp at a lecture for the Newcastle upon Tyne Chemical Society on 18 December 1878.,demonstrated,Swan,DYNAMIC
