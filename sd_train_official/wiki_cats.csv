The domestic cat was first classified as Felis catus by Carolus Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae in 1758.,classified,cat,DYNAMIC
"However, because of modern phylogenetics, domestic cats are now usually regarded as another subspecies of the wildcat, Felis silvestris.",regarded,cats,STATIVE

There are two main theories about how cats were domesticated.,are,theories,STATIVE
