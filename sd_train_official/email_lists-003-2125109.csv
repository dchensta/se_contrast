but Pine does do a few things with character sets.,do,docno,DYNAMIC
For example if you set Pine to use ISO-8859-1,set,you,DYNAMIC
and send an all ASCII message,send,Pine,DYNAMIC
it will tag it US-ASCII (instead of ISO-8859-1).,tag,it,DYNAMIC
"Also, it's smart enough to display the lower 128 for all incoming messages in the ISO-8859-X characters sets and greek the ones",'s,it,STATIVE
it can't if the character set of the receiving Pine is US-ASCII or ISO-8859-X.,is,character,STATIVE
