Hi Laurence -,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Perhaps all that is needed is a list in the system .,is,docno,STATIVE
"pinerc file of all the valid charsets,",file,pinerc,CANNOT_DECIDE
and not let the user set her charset to one,let,pinerc,CANNOT_DECIDE
that is not in the list.,is,one,STATIVE
"So, perhaps Pine could have US-ASCII, ISO-2022-JP,",have,Pine,STATIVE
"and the various ISO-8859-x sets wired in as an initial list,",wired,sets,STATIVE
and the system file specify additional valid sets?,file,Pine,CANNOT_DECIDE
The concern is to avoid letting users do things like set it to things such as ``Latin-1'' or ``ASCII'' or similar bogons...,is,concern,STATIVE
What do you think?,think,things,CANNOT_DECIDE
