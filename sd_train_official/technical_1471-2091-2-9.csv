Background,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Ecto-Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (E-NTPDases, formerly called ecto-ATPases)",,,STATIVE
hydrolyze nucleotides in the presence of divalent cations,,,DYNAMIC
"and are insensitive to inhibitors of P-type, F-type, and V-type ATPases [ 1 ] .",,,STATIVE
"Three isoforms that differ in the ratio of ATPase/ADPase activity are present on the cell surface [ 2 ] : E-NTPDase1 with a ratio of 1, E-NTPDase2 with a ratio of 10 and E-NTPDase3 with a ratio of 3-5.",,,STATIVE
"NTPDases are important in many physiological processes like cell motility, adhesion, nonsynaptic information transfer, secretion, regulation of hemostasis and ectokinases [ 1 ] .",,,STATIVE
"Understanding the enzymatic mechanisms of the NTPDases will help description of their physiological functions, and development of strategies to regulate the functions of the enzymes.",,,DYNAMIC
The catalytic mechanism of NTPDases is not known,,,STATIVE
even though some basic facts of the catalysis have been established.,,,DYNAMIC
"NTPDases do not form phosphorylated intermediates during catalysis, a conclusion",,,DYNAMIC
also supported by lack of vanadate sensitivity and Pi product inhibition [ 3 4 5 6 ] .,,,STATIVE
The catalytic reaction appears to be irreversible,,,STATIVE
and no partial reactions have been observed [ 7 8 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
Divalent cations like Ca 2+or Mg 2+are,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"required for activity,",,,STATIVE
and maximal activity is reached,,,DYNAMIC
when the concentrations of substrates and divalent cations are equal [ 1 ] .,,,STATIVE
The specific activities of NTPDases vary over a broad range from ten thousand units for potato apyrase to less than one hundred units for chicken gizzard ecto-ATPase [ 9 10 ] .,,,STATIVE
Sequence comparisons indicate,,,STATIVE
"that most of NTPDases contain five highly conserved regions, apyrase conserved region, ACR1 - ACR5 [ 9 11 ] .",,,STATIVE
"However, the catalytic sites have not been identified,",,,DYNAMIC
"although ACR1 and ACR4 have been implicated in - and -phosphate binding, respectively [ 9 ] .",,,DYNAMIC
"E-NTPDase1 is also called CD39,",,,STATIVE
as it was first described as an antigen present on activated B and T lymphocytes.,,,DYNAMIC
Residues of ACR1 to ACR5 of CD39 have been mutated to study the involvement of the ACR regions in catalysis.,,,DYNAMIC
E174 in ACR3 and S218 in ACR4 are required for catalytic function [ 12 ] .,,,STATIVE
Substitution of H59 in ACR1 converted CD39 into an ADPase in a quaternary structure dependent manner [ 13 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
"Mutation of W187A in ACR3 affected CD39 folding and translocation,",,,DYNAMIC
while mutation of W459A in ACR5 increased ATPase activity,,,DYNAMIC
but diminished ADPase activity [ 14 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
Mutations of D62 and G64 of ACR1 and D219 and G221 of ACR4 demonstrated,,,DYNAMIC
that the nucleotide phosphate binding domains of NTPDases are similar to those present in the actin/heat shock protein/sugar kinase superfamily [ 15 ] .,,,STATIVE
These results suggest,,,STATIVE
that the conserved residues of the ACR1 to 5 regions are involved in the catalytic mechanism of CD39.,,,STATIVE
The catalytic activity of CD39 is dependent on the presence of divalent cations.,,,STATIVE
"Since the interactions of Ca +2and Mg +2with proteins are difficult to study due to the lack of spectroscopic properties, vanadyl",,,STATIVE
(V IV=O) 2+has been used as a probe of the ligands,,,DYNAMIC
"that compose Mg 2+, Ca 2+, and Mn 2+binding sites of several proteins,",,,STATIVE
"including carboxypeptidase [ 16 ] , S-adenosylmethionine synthetase [ 17 18 ] , pyruvate kinase [ 19 20 ] , and F 1 -ATPase [ 21 22 ] .",,,STATIVE
This cation specifically binds to divalent cation binding sites,,,DYNAMIC
"of several enzymes, and in many cases serves as a functional cofactor [ 23 ] .",,,DYNAMIC
"Vanadyl has one axial and four equatorial coordination sites relative to the axis of the double-bounded oxygen, an arrangement",,,STATIVE
that is similar to that for Ca 2+and Mg 2+.,,,STATIVE
As it is known that the A and g tensors,,,STATIVE
"derived from the EPR spectrum of bound VO 2+are a direct measure of the nature of the equatorial metal ligands [ 24 ] , binding of VO 2+to CD39 could provide details about the catalytic mechanism of CD39.",,,DYNAMIC
Recently we reported,,,DYNAMIC
"that a recombinant soluble CD39, capable of hydrolyzing both ATP and ADP, was expressed and purified from insect cells [ 25 ] .",,,DYNAMIC
Only one nucleotide-binding site was identified on the purified soluble CD39 in the presence of Ca 2+when,,,DYNAMIC
non-hydrolysable nucleotide analogs were used.,,,DYNAMIC
"In this report, we characterized",,,DYNAMIC
the signals that were obtained from bound VO 2+when ATP or ADP was present at the catalytic site of the purified soluble CD39.,,,DYNAMIC
The possible metal ligands for VO +2at,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
the catalytic site are proposed,,,STATIVE
and the catalytic mechanism is discussed.,,,STATIVE
Results,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Nucleotidase activity of purified soluble CD39 with VO 2+as cofactor The ability of purified soluble CD39 to hydrolyze,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
VO 2+ATP is shown in Figure 1.,,,STATIVE
Soluble CD39 did not hydrolyze either ATP or ADP in the absence of VO 2+(Fig.,,,DYNAMIC
1A).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"When VO 2+was mixed with ATP at a ratio of 1:1,",,,DYNAMIC
the concentrations of both ADP and AMP increased,,,DYNAMIC
and ATP decreased,,,DYNAMIC
as the incubation time was prolonged (Fig.,,,DYNAMIC
1B).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The ATPase activity of sCD39 with VO 2+was about 25% of that with Ca 2+as a cofactor.,,,STATIVE
Vanadyl is unstable in aqueous solution at pH7.0 in the absence of chelator,,,STATIVE
and will precipitate out of solution as [VO(OH) 2 ] n .,,,DYNAMIC
The rate of precipitation depends on the abundance and affinity of the chelator.,,,STATIVE
This means,,,STATIVE
that the actual VO 2+concentration was lower than 0.5 mM.,,,STATIVE
This result indicates,,,STATIVE
that VO 2+can functionally substitute for Ca 2+as cofactor for sCD39 nucleotidase activity.,,,DYNAMIC
Characterization of bound VO,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
2+ADPNP by CW-EPR The parallel features of CW-EPR spectrum of bound VO,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"2+in the presence of ADPNP, an ATP analog, are shown in Figure 2a.",,,STATIVE
This spectrum shows 51V hyperfine splitting and the center of the parallel transitions from molecules,,,STATIVE
with the V=O bond oriented along the magnetic field,,,STATIVE
"(A || , g || ) which are strong enough to tell the nature of VO 2+equatorial ligands [ 22 ] .",,,STATIVE
"Of the eight transitions that result from the parallel oriented molecules, the -7/2 || , -5/2 || , +3/2 || , +5/2 || , and +7/2 || transitions",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"(shown in the figures from left to right, respectively)",,,STATIVE
do not overlap with perpendicular transitions.,,,STATIVE
The 51V hyperfine splitting spectra from molecules with V=O bond perpendicular to the magnetic field (A) are much smaller and not shown here [ 21 ] .,,,STATIVE
"The intensity of -5/2 || peak is used as direct measurement of the amount of bound VO 2+,",,,DYNAMIC
since this peak is the most intense peak in the EPR spectrum,,,STATIVE
that contains contribution only from A || but not A [ 21 26 ] .,,,STATIVE
"In this study, the intensities of each bound VO 2+-EPR feature were normalized to 1 mg of protein.",,,DYNAMIC
VO 2+bound as the VO 2+-AMPPNP complex to sCD39 produced a strong spectrum,,,DYNAMIC
characterized by A || of 504.25 MHz and g || of 1.9410 (Fig.,,,STATIVE
"2b), called species T (Table 1).",,,STATIVE
The best fit of EPR species T to eq 1 is one equatorial nitrogen from an amino group and three equatorial oxygen ligands from carboxyl or phosphate groups (Table 2).,,,STATIVE
This result is consistent with AMPPNP,,,STATIVE
binding strongly to a single site on sCD39 in the presence of metal [ 25 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
Characterization of EPR species from VO 2+-AMPCP bound to sCD39 Figure 3ashows the parallel features of the EPR spectrum of sCD39 bound VO 2+-AMPCP.,,,STATIVE
"Two sets of parallel transitions were observed,",,,DYNAMIC
and the derived A || and g || values are listed in Table 1.,,,STATIVE
"One set had A || of 521.78 MHz and g || of 1.937,",,,STATIVE
which is defined as species D1 (Fig.,,,STATIVE
3b).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"The other set displayed A || of 490.01 MHz and g || of 1.9435,",,,STATIVE
which is called species D2 (Fig.,,,STATIVE
3c).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The intensity of species D1 accounted for 11.4% of species,,,STATIVE
"T from bound VO 2+-AMPPNP,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
and the intensity of D2 accounted for 7.1% of species,,,STATIVE
T. The intensity ratio of species D1 over D2 was 1.6.,,,STATIVE
"In order to distinguish species D1 from D2,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"the sample with VO 2+-AMPCP bound to sCD39 was thawed and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes,",,,DYNAMIC
and the VO 2+EPR spectrum was collected again.,,,DYNAMIC
"As shown in Figure 4aand 4b, either A || or g || values for both species D1 and D2 were changed.",,,DYNAMIC
The intensity of species D1 was not changed,,,DYNAMIC
as it accounted for 12.1% of the intensity of species T of the bound VO 2+-AMPPNP.,,,STATIVE
"However, the intensity of species D2 was decreased dramatically,",,,DYNAMIC
and it accounted for only 0.1% of the intensity of species,,,STATIVE
T. The intensity ratio of D1 over D2 increased,,,DYNAMIC
about 75 fold to become 120.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
There are two sets of equatorial ligands,,,STATIVE
that can fit well the EPR species D1 according to Eq 1 (Table 2).,,,STATIVE
"One set includes two equatorial oxygen from two water molecules, one equatorial oxygen from a carboxyl group or phosphate, and one equatorial nitrogen from an amino group.",,,STATIVE
The other set contains one equatorial oxygen from water and three equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups or phosphate.,,,STATIVE
The best fit for the EPR species D2 to eq 1 is one equatorial oxygen from a hydroxyl group and three equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups or phosphate.,,,STATIVE
EPR characteristics of sCD39 bound VO 2+-ATP,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
In order to capture the bound VO 2+-EPR signal,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"before the enzyme completely turned over, sCD39 and VO 2+-ATP were mixed on ice,",,,DYNAMIC
immediately transferred into the EPR tube,,,DYNAMIC
and frozen.,,,DYNAMIC
The entire process took about 15 seconds.,,,DYNAMIC
The parallel portion of the collected VO 2+-EPR spectrum is shown in Figure 5a.,,,STATIVE
"VO 2+-ATP complex bound to sCD39 produced an EPR spectrum with A || of 489.5 MHz and g || of 1.9455,",,,DYNAMIC
which corresponded to species D2 (Fig.,,,STATIVE
5b).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The signal intensity from the bound VO 2+-nucleotide complex accounted only for 7.5% of that of species,,,STATIVE
T from bound non-hydrolysable VO 2+-ADPNP complex.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"The same sample made from mixing VO 2+-ATP and sCD39 was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes,",,,DYNAMIC
then the VO 2+-EPR spectrum was generated,,,DYNAMIC
as shown in Figures 4cand 4d.,,,STATIVE
"The EPR parameters derived from this VO 2+-EPR spectrum were 489.5 MHz for A || and 1.9455 for g || respectively,",,,STATIVE
which is consistent with species D2.,,,STATIVE
"However, the signal intensity decreased",,,DYNAMIC
about 37.5 fold compared to that,,,STATIVE
obtained before room temperature incubation.,,,DYNAMIC
Free VO 2+binding to sCD39 characterized by CD-EPR Like other metals,,,STATIVE
"(Ca 2+and Mg 2+), free VO 2+inhibited the nucleotidase activities of sCD39 at high concentration",,,DYNAMIC
(data not shown).,,,STATIVE
VO 2+in the absence of any nucleotides was added to sCD39 at 1:1 molar ratio.,,,DYNAMIC
The parallel transitions of bound VO 2+-EPR spectrum are shown in Figure 6.,,,STATIVE
"The features derived from the VO 2+-EPR spectrum were 486 MHz for A || and 1.946 for g || ,",,,STATIVE
which was designed as species V (Fig.,,,DYNAMIC
6b).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The signal intensity of bound VO 2+accounted for 20.3% of that from the bound VO 2+-ADPNP complex.,,,STATIVE
The best fit of equatorial ligands for species V according to eq 1 is two equatorial oxygen from hydroxyl groups and another two equatorial oxygen from two water molecules.,,,STATIVE
Discussion,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Vanadyl has been used to estimate the types of groups,,,DYNAMIC
that serve as metal-ligands in F 1,,,STATIVE
-ATPase and other enzymes [ 16 18 19 21 ],,,CANNOT_DECIDE
because the g and A tensors of the 51V hyperfine couplings are approximately a linear combination of tensors from each type of group,,,STATIVE
that contributes an equatorial ligand [ 24 27 ] .,,,STATIVE
"By studying the EPR spectra of bound VO 2+in the presence of different nucleotides,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
we show,,,STATIVE
that the interaction of soluble CD39 with ATP is different from that with ADP.,,,STATIVE
It is not surprising,,,STATIVE
"that VO 2+can functionally replace Ca 2+in the hydrolysis of both ATP and ADP by soluble CD39,",,,DYNAMIC
"although the enzymatic activity is about 25% of that with Ca 2+as the cofactor,",,,STATIVE
since F 1 -ATPase also hydrolyzes ATP at a decreased rate,,,DYNAMIC
when VO 2+replaces,,,DYNAMIC
Mg 2+ [ 21 ] .,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The EPR features of VO 2+are able to reveal some details about how CD39 hydrolyzes ATP and ADP.,,,STATIVE
"A single EPR feature, species T, was observed",,,DYNAMIC
when ADPNP (a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP) complexed with VO 2+was,,,STATIVE
"bound to sCD39,",,,DYNAMIC
which is consistent with the presence of only one nucleotide binding site [ 25 ] .,,,STATIVE
"The g and A tensors derived from species T are 1.9410 and 504.25 MHz respectively,",,,STATIVE
which can be fitted best with one amino group and three groups combined from carboxyl and phosphate groups as the equatorial ligands of the bound VO 2+on sCD39.,,,STATIVE
"In accordance with metal-ATP complex coordination on other enzymes that hydrolyze ATP,",,,DYNAMIC
"like F 1 -ATPase [ 22 28 ] , the - and -phosphate of ATP most likely bind to VO 2+while the third carboxyl group is contributed by a side-chain of aspartate or glutamate of sCD39.",,,DYNAMIC
It is not unusual,,,STATIVE
for the -amino group of lysine to coordinate with metals in enzymes.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
It has been reported,,,DYNAMIC
"that the amino group serves as one of VO 2+equatorial ligands in CF 1 -ATPase [ 21 ] , pyruvate kinase [ 19 20 ] , AdoMet synthetase [ 17 18 ] , and carboxypeptidase [ 16 ] .",,,STATIVE
"Thus one amino group from lysine, one carboxyl group from aspartate or glutamate, and two oxygens from the phosphates of ADPNP serve as the equatorial ligands of sCD39 bound VO",,,STATIVE
2+in the presence of ADPNP.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"In the presence of AMPCP, bound VO 2+produced two EPR features, species D1 and species D2",,,DYNAMIC
that are separated by about 30 MHz.,,,STATIVE
As we have reported,,,DYNAMIC
that sCD39 releases intermediate ADP,,,DYNAMIC
"before ADP is further cleaved during ATP hydrolysis [ 25 ] ,",,,DYNAMIC
sCD39 probably has two conformations,,,STATIVE
"that bind metal-ADP complexes, one is the conformation",,,DYNAMIC
"that releases the ADP intermediate, and another",,,DYNAMIC
that recruits intermediate ADP back to the enzyme,,,DYNAMIC
for further hydrolysis to AMP.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"However, intact CD39 does not release intermediate ADP during ATP hydrolysis,",,,DYNAMIC
suggesting,,,STATIVE
that there is only one ADP binding site on each CD39 monomer in the intact protein [ 2 25 ] .,,,STATIVE
The two EPR species observed,,,DYNAMIC
with VO 2+-AMPCP probably correspond to the two different conformations of bound ADP at the same catalytic site on sCD39.,,,STATIVE
The signal intensity of the bound VO 2+-AMPCP EPR spectrum,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
indicates,,,STATIVE
that species D1 is dominant over species D2.,,,STATIVE
"In order to further assign species D1 and D2 to the two different conformations, two experiments were done (Fig.",,,DYNAMIC
5).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Incubation of sCD39 with VO 2+-AMPCP at room temperature resulted in a dramatic decrease of the intensity of species D2,",,,DYNAMIC
while the signal intensity of species D1 remained unchanged.,,,STATIVE
These data indicate,,,STATIVE
that VO 2+-AMPCP was released from the conformation,,,DYNAMIC
corresponding to species D2;,,,STATIVE
"however, the conformation corresponding to species D1 still had bound VO 2+-AMPCP.",,,STATIVE
More evidence for two conformations of the enzyme was obtained from the EPR spectra of bound VO 2+-ATP.,,,DYNAMIC
No species T was found,,,DYNAMIC
presumably because ATP was converted to ADP,,,DYNAMIC
before the sample was frozen.,,,DYNAMIC
Only species D2 was observed,,,DYNAMIC
and its intensity decreased,,,DYNAMIC
as the incubation time was prolonged.,,,DYNAMIC
We suggest,,,STATIVE
that species D2 corresponds to the conformation,,,STATIVE
that releases ADP as an intermediate product and species D1 corresponds to the conformation,,,STATIVE
that binds ADP as a substrate.,,,DYNAMIC
The lower signal intensities of species D1 and D2 compared to that of species,,,STATIVE
T suggest,,,STATIVE
"that the affinity of sCD39 for ADP or its analog AMPCP is lower than that for the ATP analog ADPNP,",,,STATIVE
which is consistent with the result,,,STATIVE
that only ATP analogs were detected on sCD39 [ 25 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
The calculated g || and A || values,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
that best matched the experimental values for species,,,STATIVE
D2 suggest that one hydroxyl group and three oxygens,,,STATIVE
derived from carboxyl groups and phosphates are the equatorial ligands of bound VO 2+-ADP.,,,STATIVE
Since the conformation corresponding to species D2 is found in the presence of ATP,,,DYNAMIC
and is likely to be the conformation,,,STATIVE
"that releases bound VO +2-ADP,",,,DYNAMIC
it is likely,,,STATIVE
that the VO +2ligands are one phosphate and two carboxyl groups [ 25 ] .,,,STATIVE
When ADP is the substrate,,,STATIVE
"and generates species D1, one water molecule and a combination of three groups between carboxyl groups and phosphates serve as the equatorial ligands of bound VO 2+on sCD39.",,,DYNAMIC
The probable combination of carboxyl groups and phosphates for species D1 is one carboxyl group and two phosphates since VO 2+complexes ADP through two phosphates,,,STATIVE
before VO 2+-ADP is bound to the enzyme.,,,DYNAMIC
The site directed mutagenesis studies on CD39,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
and other members of the CD39 family give some hints about the possible residues,,,DYNAMIC
that serve as metal ligands at the catalytic site of sCD39.,,,STATIVE
"The changes of D62 on ACR1, E174 on ACR3, D213 (D219 in HB6) and S218 on ACR4 dramatically decrease both ATPase and ADPase activities of CD39 [ 12 15 ] .",,,DYNAMIC
"Figure 7summarizes the possible coordination of Ca 2+from the data of species T, species D1, and species D2 in the different situations of sCD39 catalysis.",,,STATIVE
"The catalytic base attack results in cleavage of the -phosphate of ATP,",,,DYNAMIC
and one carboxyl group replaces the -phosphate as a metal ligand,,,DYNAMIC
"(from species T to species D2),",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
which is accompanied by a swap of an amino group with a hydroxyl group (S218?).,,,STATIVE
This hydroxyl group (S218?),,,CANNOT_DECIDE
probably interacts with the water molecule through hydrogen bond in the conformation corresponding to species,,,DYNAMIC
D1 to hydrolyze ADP.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The constant carboxyl group that appears in all conformations of sCD39 hydrolysis is likely contributed by D213,,,STATIVE
since it is close to S218.,,,STATIVE
The results presented here also provide an explanation to the free metal inhibition of CD39 catalytic activity.,,,STATIVE
Free VO 2+binds to sCD39 through two hydroxyl groups and two water molecules,,,DYNAMIC
that are hydrogen bonded to other residues of sCD39.,,,STATIVE
"Once free VO 2+occupies the catalytic site, the enzyme has to either release the metal",,,DYNAMIC
or correct the conformation,,,DYNAMIC
before the substrates are recruited properly.,,,DYNAMIC
Conclusions,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
VO 2+can functionally substitute for Ca 2+as a cofactor for sCD39.,,,DYNAMIC
Four different EPR spectra are obtained for VO 2+bound in the presence of different nucleotides and in the absence of nucleotide.,,,DYNAMIC
The protein ligands for VO +2in,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"the presence of ATP are suggested to be carboxyl and amino groups,",,,STATIVE
while those in the presence of ADP are probably carboxyl and hydroxyl groups.,,,STATIVE
The mechanism of sCD catalysis is discussed.,,,STATIVE
These results will provide guides for further studies of the catalytic mechanism of NTPDases.,,,DYNAMIC
