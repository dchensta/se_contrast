You may be familiar with the concept: Jet lag.,be,You,STATIVE

The pathophysiology of jet lag,lag,pathophysiology,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Normally, two systems -- the homeostatic system and the circadian system -- work together to produce a 24-hour sleep cycle.",work,systems,DYNAMIC
"During the day, the homeostatic system slowly accumulates a 'sleep drive,' a desire to sleep",accumulates,system,DYNAMIC
that increases as a function of time spent awake.,spent,time,DYNAMIC
"The circadian system generates an alerting signal in opposition to this sleep drive,",generates,system,DYNAMIC
"which, during the day, keeps a person from feeling increasingly sleepy.",keeps,drive,STATIVE
"An hour or two before bedtime, this signal subsides, and s/he realizes",signal,this,DYNAMIC
it's time to hit the pillow.,hit,time,STATIVE
The sleep drive dissipates,dissipates,drive,DYNAMIC
as a person sleeps,sleeps,person,CANNOT_DECIDE
"and by morning (assuming a full night's rest and possibly some coffee), s/he will be feeling alert and ready to go again.",feeling,drive,STATIVE
"Robert Sack wrote a delightful paper [PDF] on jet lag,",wrote,Sack,DYNAMIC
"by the way, which is where I'm getting much of my information.",is,way,STATIVE
So we've got a nice cycle of sleep.,got,we,STATIVE
Jet lag is what happens,is,lag,STATIVE
when the homeostatic and circadian processes are misaligned.,misaligned,processes,STATIVE
"For example, the circadian system may signal a person to be alert",signal,system,DYNAMIC
"when it's not actually morning,",'s,it,STATIVE
"or may be reduced during daytime hours,",reduced,system,STATIVE
causing daytime sleepiness,causing,,DYNAMIC
because the homeostatic sleep drive is no longer cancelled out.,cancelled,drive,STATIVE
But I don't want to be sleepy!,want,I,STATIVE
How do you beat jet lag?,beat,you,CANNOT_DECIDE
Robert Sack lists three primary approaches:,lists,Sack,STATIVE
Reset the body clock,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Prescribed sleep scheduling Medication to counteract daytime sleepiness or insomnia,sleep,Reset,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Let's start with the first one,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
as it turns out to be the most complicated.,turns,it,DYNAMIC
Resetting the body clock,Resetting,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"The two most effective ways to reset the body clock are 1) through bright light exposure, and 2) timed melatonin administration.",timed,Resetting,STATIVE
Light is one of the most important cues about time of day,is,Light,STATIVE
and has the greatest effect on circadian timing,has,Light,STATIVE
"(much smaller effects are seen from regular activities and meals, for example).",seen,one,DYNAMIC
Studies have shown,shown,Studies,DYNAMIC
"that without light cues, totally blind people tend to have free-running circadian rhythms with an average period of 24.5 hours, instead of the usual 24.",tend,people,STATIVE
"If a person is exposed to bright light early in the day,",exposed,person,DYNAMIC
the person's internal clock is reset to an earlier time;,is,clock,DYNAMIC
"if exposure is instead in the evening,",is,exposure,STATIVE
the internal clock is reset to a later time.,is,,DYNAMIC
Brighter light has more of an effect,has,light,STATIVE
"(such as the sun, at 3000 to 10,000 lux), though lower intensities (e.g., 100-550 lux)",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
can produce changes.,produce,intensities,DYNAMIC
"Artificial light sources can be used to supplement daylight, to help reset a person's internal clock to the correct new time zone",used,sources,DYNAMIC
when traveling.,traveling,,DYNAMIC
"Alternatively, a person could wear very dark glasses,",wear,person,STATIVE
as light avoidance could help minimize the problems of light exposure at the wrong time of day or night.,help,avoidance,DYNAMIC
"Resetting the body clock, Part 2: Melatonin",Resetting,hormone,CANNOT_DECIDE
Melatonin is a hormone,is,Part,STATIVE
that has been linked to the regulation of circadian rhythms and sleep cycles [PDF].,linked,hormone,DYNAMIC
Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland at night;,secreted,Melatonin,DYNAMIC
"secretion is suppressed by light exposure,",suppressed,secretion,DYNAMIC
"and as such, the hormone can be thought of as a ""darkness signal.""",thought,secretion,STATIVE
"If doses of melatonin are administered in the morning, circadian rhythms will be shifted later; evening doses shift rhythms earlier.",shifted,rhythms,DYNAMIC
"Timing of the doses is more important than amount per dose,",is,Timing,STATIVE
though it remains to be seen,remains,it,STATIVE
what the optimal dose and optimal time of administration is,is,time,STATIVE
"-- trials have been done with doses from 0.5 to 10mg, at times",done,trials,DYNAMIC
ranging from three days before departure to five days after arrival in the new time zone.,ranging,times,STATIVE
"If doses of melatonin are combined with light exposure, the results are what you might expect: synergistic",expect,you,STATIVE
if both are administered to produce a time shift in the same direction (both earlier or both later); antagonistic otherwise.,administered,both,DYNAMIC

The second way to beat jet lag: Sleep at weird times.,beat,Sleep,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Slowly adjust your sleep schedule to match that of your destination,",adjust,Slowly,CANNOT_DECIDE
or keep your home sleep schedule for a while,keep,Slowly,CANNOT_DECIDE
after you arrive.,arrive,you,DYNAMIC
"The problem with this is that your sleep-wake schedule won't match up with that of the people around you,",is,problem,STATIVE
"and if you need to be awake for breakfast at 7am or for a meeting in the afternoon, your sleep schedule may interfere.",interfere,problem,DYNAMIC
Use this method at your own risk.,Use,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Drugs for everything,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Lastly, we have sleep medicines.",have,Drugs,STATIVE
"As you might guess, hypnotic medications combat insomnia and stimulants fight off daytime sleepiness pretty well,",medications,hypnotic,DYNAMIC
"because by definition, that's what they do.",'s,that,DYNAMIC
Both benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine drugs have been shown to be effective in the first case;,shown,drugs,DYNAMIC
"for the latter, the most common solution is to consume more coffee [PDF].",is,solution,STATIVE
This works!,,,DYNAMIC
"In the study linked, subjects were treated with slow-release caffeine or with melatonin prior to a long eastward flight;",treated,subjects,DYNAMIC
the caffeine subjects were less sleepy than either melatonin or placebo.,were,subjects,STATIVE
"Granted, caffeine subjects also took longer to fall asleep later",took,subjects,STATIVE
"and awoke more frequently,",awoke,subjects,DYNAMIC
but that may be a risk,be,that,STATIVE
you have to take.,have,you,STATIVE
Lagging behind,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Light, melatonin, drugs, strange sleep schedules.",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Of course, the only solution that will always work is time.",is,solution,STATIVE
"The homeostatic and circadian processes need to realign,",need,processes,STATIVE
"and while the aforementioned ways of beating jet lag can fast track the process,",track,ways,DYNAMIC
it still takes time.,takes,processes,STATIVE
UPDATE: ; I was alerted by a friend of the existence further research,alerted,I,DYNAMIC
of which I was unaware:,was,I,STATIVE
Another way to reset,reset,way,CANNOT_DECIDE
your sleep-wake cycle is to stop eating .,is,way,STATIVE
"If you fast for about 12 to 16 hours, your body clock will reset, with whatever time you break your fast as morning.",reset,clock,DYNAMIC
