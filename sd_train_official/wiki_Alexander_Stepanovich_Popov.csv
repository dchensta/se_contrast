Along with his teaching duties at the naval school Popov pursued related areas of research.,pursued,Popov,DYNAMIC
Trying to solve a problem with the failure in the electrical wire insulation on steel ships,Trying,currents,DYNAMIC
(which turned out to be a problem with electrical resonance) led him to further explore oscillations of high frequency electrical currents.,led,Trying,DYNAMIC
"His interest in this area of study (including the new field of ""Hertzian"" or radio waves) was intensified by his trip in 1893 to the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition in the United States",including,,DYNAMIC

Popov also read a 1894 article about British physicist Oliver Lodge's experiments,read,Popov,DYNAMIC
related to the discovery of radio waves by German physicist Heinrich Hertz 6 years earlier.,related,experiments,STATIVE
"On 1 June 1894, after the death of Hertz, British physicist Oliver Lodge gave a memorial lecture on Hertz experiments.",gave,Lodge,DYNAMIC
He set up a demonstration on the quasi optical nature of Hertzian waves,set,He,DYNAMIC
(radio waves) and demonstrated their transmission at distances up to 50 meters.,demonstrated,He,DYNAMIC
Lodge used a detector,used,Lodge,DYNAMIC
"called a coherer, a glass tube",called,detector,STATIVE
containing metal filings between two electrodes.,containing,called,STATIVE
"When received waves from an antenna were applied to the electrodes, the coherer became conductive allowing the current from a battery to pass through it, with the impulse",became,coherer,DYNAMIC
being picked up by a mirror galvanometer.,picked,impulse,DYNAMIC
After receiving a signal the metal filings in the coherer had to be reset by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell,had,filings,DYNAMIC

Popov set to work to design a longer-range receiver,set,Popov,DYNAMIC
"that could be used as a lightning detector, to warn of thunderstorms by detecting the electromagnetic pulses of lightning strikes",used,receiver,DYNAMIC
using a coherer receiver.,using,strikes,DYNAMIC
===Operating principle===,Operating,,CANNOT_DECIDE
In Popov's lightning detector the coherer (C) was connected to an antenna,connected,coherer,STATIVE
"(A), and to a separate circuit with a relay (R) and battery (V)",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
which operated an electric bell (B).,operated,circuit,DYNAMIC

"the current from the battery was applied to the relay,",applied,current,DYNAMIC

which applied current to the electromagnet,applied,contacts,DYNAMIC
"(E) of the bell,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE

"Popov added an innovative automatic reset feature of a ""self tapping"" coherer",added,Popov,DYNAMIC
where the bell arm would spring back,spring,arm,DYNAMIC
"and tap the coherer,",tap,arm,DYNAMIC
restoring it to its receptive state.,restoring,Popov,DYNAMIC
The two chokes (L),,,CANNOT_DECIDE
in the coherer's leads prevented the radio signal across the coherer from short circuiting by passing through the DC circuit.,prevented,chokes,DYNAMIC
He connected his receiver to a wire antenna (A) suspended high in the air and to a ground (earth) (G).,connected,He,DYNAMIC
The antenna idea may have been based on a lightning rod,based,idea,STATIVE
and was an early use of a monopole wire aerial.,was,,STATIVE

"which described his lightning detector, to the Russian Physical and Chemical Society in St. Petersburg.",described,Popov,DYNAMIC
"Most Eastern sources regard Popov's lightning detector as the first radio receiver,",regard,sources,STATIVE
"and the 7th of May has been celebrated since 1945 in the Russian Federation as ""Radio Day"".",celebrated,sources,DYNAMIC
"However, there is no evidence",is,evidence,STATIVE
Popov sent any type of message on that occasion.,sent,Popov,DYNAMIC
"The first account of communication by Popov was a demonstration on 24 March 1896 at the Physical and Chemical Society,",was,account,STATIVE

Historian Charles Susskind in 1962 concluded,concluded,Susskind,DYNAMIC
that Popov did not use radio waves for actual wireless communication before mid-1896.,use,Popov,DYNAMIC
In 1895 Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began work on a purpose built wireless telegraphy system,began,Marconi,DYNAMIC
"based on ""Hertzian"" (radio) waves,",based,system,STATIVE
developing a spark-gap transmitter and a much improved automatically-reset coherer receiver.,developing,Marconi,DYNAMIC

1/2 mile (1600 meters).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
He then came up with the idea,came,He,DYNAMIC
grounding his transmitter as well as his receiver,grounding,He,DYNAMIC
and by mid-1896 he was transmitting radio messages a mile and a half (2400 meters).,transmitting,He,DYNAMIC
Popov and Marconi's early work seems to have been done,seems,work,STATIVE
without knowledge of each other's system although reading Marconis June 1896 patent disclosures led Popov to develop a long range wireless telegraphy system.,led,reading,DYNAMIC
"His paper on his experiments: ""On the relation of metallic powders to electrical oscillations"", was published 15 December 1895.",published,paper,DYNAMIC
He did not apply for a patent for his invention.,apply,He,DYNAMIC

"In 1896, the article depicting Popov's invention was reprinted in the 'Journal of the Russian Physical and Chemical Society'.",reprinted,article,DYNAMIC
"In March 1896, he effected transmission of radio waves between different campus buildings in St. Petersburg.",effected,he,DYNAMIC
