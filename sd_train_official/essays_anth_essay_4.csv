Indigenous Revitalization Movements of Latin America:,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The Rediscovery of Language and Identity,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Humans, in the process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors",look,May,DYNAMIC
in order to differentiate themselves from others.,differentiate,,CANNOT_DECIDE
This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture:,leads,process,DYNAMIC
"a group of people joined by characteristics, traits, and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity, discernible from that of those outside them, those",comes,group,DYNAMIC
who do not belong.,belong,those,STATIVE
"Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things - clothing, food, lifestyle choices.",signaled,this,DYNAMIC
One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language.,noted,One,STATIVE
"The command of a language, while not affording guaranteed access to the community",affording,key,STATIVE
"which speaks it,",speaks,community,DYNAMIC
is often the key to gaining entry.,is,command,STATIVE
In turn communal identity can be formed around a language;,formed,identity,DYNAMIC
it is used as the focal point,used,it,DYNAMIC
around which the group gathers.,gathers,group,DYNAMIC
Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements,considering,,DYNAMIC
"which began in 20th century Latin America, the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key.",is,impact,DYNAMIC
"Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity,",plays,Language,STATIVE
particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has.,oppressed,identity,DYNAMIC
"In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases, that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia.",examine,I,DYNAMIC
Their struggle to attain status in societies,attain,struggle,CANNOT_DECIDE
"still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their indigenous identity,",tied,struggle,STATIVE
and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages.,is,struggle,STATIVE
The effects of Spanish colonialism are both far-reaching and deeply embedded in both countries.,are,effects,STATIVE
"One of the most prominent, lasting influences is that of the land grant system.",is,One,STATIVE
"Initially the Spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system,",attempted,government,DYNAMIC
in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land.,maintained,conquistador,DYNAMIC
This was in turn replaced by the repartimento;,was,This,DYNAMIC
the natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws,allowed,natives,STATIVE
"but remained in every way the inferior of the Spanish,",remained,natives,STATIVE
providing labor and taxes as demanded.,providing,natives,DYNAMIC
"In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish,",were,rights,STATIVE
"resulting in modern-day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists (Warren 1978, 7-8).",resulting,right,DYNAMIC
Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers.,are,peoples,STATIVE
The impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the Marxist movements of the early 20th century.,recognized,plight,DYNAMIC
Those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations;,were,articulate,STATIVE
"previously, both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant Spanish culture.",maintained,the,STATIVE
"The Marxists, on the contrary, argued",argued,Marxists,DYNAMIC
that the indigenous peoples possessed a unique identity.,possessed,peoples,STATIVE
"However, they also claimed",claimed,they,DYNAMIC
"that they were part of a larger group, the working class,",were,they,STATIVE
whose poverty was a direct result of American imperialism;,was,poverty,STATIVE
therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements,join,they,DYNAMIC
in order to reorganize society into a worker-friendly one (Jackson 1995: 6-7).,reorganize,,CANNOT_DECIDE
In Colombia this resulted in a civil war between the Liberal and Communist parties and Conservative party.,resulted,this,DYNAMIC
"A truce established between the Liberals and Conservatives failed to meet the demands of the Communists,",failed,truce,DYNAMIC
who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response.,sustained,Communists,DYNAMIC
Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life;,become,warfare,DYNAMIC
"multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence,",maintain,groups,STATIVE
often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages,stationing,presence,DYNAMIC
often populated by various indigenous peoples.,populated,villages,STATIVE
This is similar to the situation of Guatemala:,is,This,STATIVE
the government felt,felt,government,STATIVE
"it needed to battle communism, an armed and dangerous menace within, plunging the country into civil warfare in the 1960s",needed,it,STATIVE
and continuing through the 1980s (Warren 1993: 25).,continuing,communism,DYNAMIC
"This resulted in persecution against the Mayans,",resulted,This,DYNAMIC
who make up about 60% of the overall population.,make,Mayans,STATIVE
"In both counties, guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples;",associated,guerrillas,STATIVE
"in many cases there were coalitions,",were,coalitions,STATIVE
"but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote, inaccessible villages as hideouts.",used,coalitions,DYNAMIC
"In Guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed,",destroyed,villages,DYNAMIC
"200,000 Mayans were killed,",killed,villages,DYNAMIC
and over 1 million more were displaced.,displaced,villages,DYNAMIC
The main guerrilla force was demilitarized in 1996 with the establishment of a peace accord (Warren 2002: 157-158).,demilitarized,force,DYNAMIC
The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements.,intertwined,growth,STATIVE
"By the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen,",seen,need,STATIVE
"and indigenous rights movements formed (Warren 2003: 174, Jackson 2002: 82).",formed,need,DYNAMIC
Central to these was the question of indigenous identity,was,Central,STATIVE
": largely lost amidst the overwhelming Spanish influence,",lost,,STATIVE
local leaders sought to rediscover their native roots,sought,leaders,DYNAMIC
and redefine,redefine,leaders,DYNAMIC
what it meant to be a part of indigenous culture.,meant,it,STATIVE
Pan-Mayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the Mayan language;,sought,Pan-Mayanism,DYNAMIC
"despite local dialectical differences, it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse Mayan people.",seen,it,STATIVE
"Most still speak it in various forms,",speak,Most,DYNAMIC
"and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent, modern version of Maya (England 2003: 733, 739).",producing,Most,DYNAMIC
Pan-Mayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity;,succeeded,Pan-Mayanism,DYNAMIC
"it largely avoids specifically political overtones,",avoids,it,DYNAMIC
instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging Mayan culture (England 2003: 734).,concentrating,overtones,DYNAMIC
"The popular left, however, continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool.",continues,left,STATIVE
It therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse .,invokes,It,DYNAMIC
The Pan-Mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies,benefits,movement,STATIVE
without risking drawing the,risking,left,DYNAMIC
"(often negative) attention of the government (England 2003: 735, Warren 2003: 181).",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
A main concern among pan-Mayanists is the reversal of the long-seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people;,is,concern,STATIVE
"despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population, they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society.",remain,they,STATIVE
This results in part from the ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism:,results,This,STATIVE
"Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility,",continues,Spanish,STATIVE
whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior.,seen,Maya,STATIVE
Pan-Mayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to Maya,seek,leaders,STATIVE
"as it was in its classical renaissance, a language of power and prestige (England 2003: 736).",was,it,STATIVE
By doing so,doing,they,DYNAMIC
they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride,hope,they,STATIVE
which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority.,reverse,sense,DYNAMIC
"Colombia, in contrast, has no unified ""pan-Indian"" sentiments;",has,Colombia,STATIVE
"the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population, a fractured entity",is,population,STATIVE
divided by region and language.,divided,entity,STATIVE
Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed:,developed,groups,DYNAMIC
"the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan-Indian group,",poses,ONIC,STATIVE
"yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 83, 85).",lacks,ONIC,STATIVE
"The CRIC, which focuses on language development and renewal,",focuses,CRIC,STATIVE
is primarily representative of the Nasa peoples (Jackson 2003: 82).,is,CRIC,STATIVE
"It often stands in conflict with the AICO, its Guambiano counterpart (Jackson 2003: 83-84).",stands,It,STATIVE
"Whereas the Mayanists benefit from a single main identity, those of Colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups (Jackson 2002: 109).",operate,those,DYNAMIC
The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre-colonial times;,stood,Nasa,STATIVE
therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best (Rappaport 2005: 2).,is,coalition,STATIVE
This reflects a desire among the peoples,reflects,This,STATIVE
"themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities, both from the Spanish Colombian population and each other.",maintain,desire,CANNOT_DECIDE
"In the 1990s the rhetoric of ""cultural diversity"" was picked up the Colombian media,",picked,rhetoric,DYNAMIC
"and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public,",entered,rhetoric,DYNAMIC
thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity,cementing,rhetoric,DYNAMIC
and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole.,complicating,rhetoric,DYNAMIC
"A major success in the Colombian saga is the revamped constitution of 1991,",is,success,STATIVE
"which includes a section on indigenous rights,",includes,1991,STATIVE
as the Congress which drafted,drafted,Congress,DYNAMIC
it included representatives from native groups (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57).,included,it,STATIVE

stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty.,stemming,system,STATIVE
"While the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups,",used,repartimento,DYNAMIC
it is now used to support them:,used,it,DYNAMIC
"resguardos, or communally owned plots of land, are granted to communities.",granted,resguardos,DYNAMIC
"They are ruled by the cabildo, local governing boards",ruled,They,DYNAMIC
formed of community leaders (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 51-52).,formed,boards,STATIVE
The return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity:,reflects,return,STATIVE
"no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse, communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era.",forced,communities,STATIVE
"The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the Colombian government to codify law, and questions",conflicts,nature,STATIVE
of human rights violations are common,are,questions,STATIVE
as punishments are often corporal in nature (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57-58).,are,punishments,STATIVE
The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of 1999.,stands,constitution,STATIVE
Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord;,gained,Mayans,DYNAMIC
by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights,floated,government,DYNAMIC

that codified in the Colombian constitution (Warren 2002: 157-158).,codified,that,STATIVE

"despite the Mayan majority; possible reasons include the overwhelming illiteracy rates among the indigenous population and inaccessibility of voting stations (Warren 2002: 149, 151).",include,reasons,STATIVE
"However, it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many Mayans to assimilate,",reflects,it,STATIVE
as they still feel,feel,they,STATIVE
"that is necessary for social mobility, and a belief among the general population",is,,STATIVE
that Mayans do not require a separate bill of rights,require,Mayans,STATIVE
"as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution (Warren 2002: 159, 172).",covered,they,STATIVE
Illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the Mayan language itself:,correlated,rates,STATIVE

recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity,recognizes,languages,STATIVE
and encourages their active promotion.,encourages,languages,DYNAMIC
"While largely symbolic, it is still significant",is,it,STATIVE
in that Guatemalan identity is seen as encompassing languages other than Spanish.,seen,it,STATIVE
This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia.,manifests,question,STATIVE
"Within the pan-Mayan movement, there remains a desire to maintain linguistic diversity:",remains,desire,STATIVE
"some view the reduction of their language to the status of ""dialect"" devalues their unique identity and place in the Mayan world;",view,some,STATIVE
"however, despite differences over standardization, the pan-Mayan movement itself is largely cohesive.",is,movement,STATIVE
"In contrast, Colombian indigenous groups are divided to the extent",divided,groups,STATIVE

"but serves to split the population, both between groups and within groups themselves.",serves,valued,STATIVE
