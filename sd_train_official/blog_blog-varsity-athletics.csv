"and at long last, folks are voting to approve it.",voting,proposal,DYNAMIC
"Or to not approve it,",approve,,CANNOT_DECIDE
but the former seems more likely.,seems,former,STATIVE
"As a member of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee and as a long-time varsity athlete, you might say",say,you,DYNAMIC
I have particular stake in the proposal.,have,I,STATIVE
"After all, I could get half a unit a semester for up to four semesters --",get,I,DYNAMIC
"a typical class is worth one unit,",is,unit,STATIVE

It seems justified:,seems,It,STATIVE
"Students can receive credit for participating in other extracurricular, faculty-supervised activities, such as the orchestra, the choir, and the repertory dance theatre, so why not varsity athletics?",receive,Students,DYNAMIC
My friend over at Carolyn Blogs agrees:,agrees,friend,STATIVE

I agree with Carolyn.,agree,I,STATIVE
The reason I participate in my sport is because I enjoy it.,is,reason,STATIVE
