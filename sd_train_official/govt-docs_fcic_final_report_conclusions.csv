this financial crisis was avoidable.,was,,STATIVE

Despite the expressed view of many on Wall Street and in Washington,,,DYNAMIC
"that the crisis could not have been foreseen or avoided, there were warning signs.",warning,signs,DYNAMIC
The tragedy was that they were ignored or discounted.,was,tragedy,STATIVE
"There was an explosion in risky subprime lending and securitization, an unsustainable rise in housing prices, widespread reports of egregious and predatory lending practices, dramatic increases in household mortgage debt, and exponential growth in financial firms trading activities, unregulated derivatives, and short-term repo lending markets, among many other red flags.",was,explosion,STATIVE

where there were neither speed limits nor neatly painted lines?,were,limits,STATIVE
We conclude widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision proved devastating to the stability of the nations financial markets.,conclude,We,DYNAMIC
"The sentries were not at their posts, in no small part due to the widely accepted faith in the self- correcting nature of the markets and the ability of financial institutions to effectively police themselves.",were,sentries,STATIVE

that we believe contributed significantly to the financial meltdown.,believe,we,STATIVE

and the mortgage securitization pipeline lit and spread the flame of contagion and crisis.,lit,We,DYNAMIC
When housing prices fell,fell,prices,DYNAMIC
"and mortgage borrowers defaulted, the lights began to dim on Wall Street.",began,lights,DYNAMIC
This report catalogues the corrosion of mortgage-lending standards and the securitization pipeline,catalogues,report,STATIVE
that transported toxic mortgages from neighborhoods across America to investors around the globe.,transported,pipeline,DYNAMIC

Nearly one-quarter of all mortgages made in the first half of 2005 were interest- only loans.,were,loans,STATIVE
"During the same year, 68% of option ARM loans originated by Countrywide and Washington Mutual had low- or no-documentation requirements.",ARM,%,STATIVE
These trends were not secret.,were,trends,STATIVE
"As irresponsible lending, including predatory and fraudulent practices, became more prevalent, the Federal Reserve and other regulators and authorities heard warnings from many quarters.",including,,DYNAMIC
Yet the Federal Reserve neglected its mission to ensure the safety and soundness of the nations banking and financial system and to protect the credit rights of consumers.,neglected,Reserve,DYNAMIC
It failed to build the retaining wall,failed,It,DYNAMIC
before it was too late.,was,it,STATIVE
"And the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, caught up in turf wars,",caught,Office,STATIVE

We conclude,conclude,We,DYNAMIC
over-the-counter derivatives contributed significantly to this crisis.,contributed,derivatives,DYNAMIC
The enactment of legislation in 2000 to ban the regulation by both the federal and state governments of over-the-counter,ban,enactment,CANNOT_DECIDE
(OTC) derivatives was a key turning point in the march toward the financial crisis.,was,enactment,STATIVE
"From financial firms to corporations, to farmers, and to investors, derivatives have been used to hedge against,",used,derivatives,DYNAMIC
"or speculate on, changes in prices, rates, or indices or even on events such as the potential defaults on debts.",speculate,derivatives,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Yet, without any oversight, OTC derivatives rapidly spiraled out of control and out of sight, growing to $673 trillion in notional amount.",spiraled,derivatives,DYNAMIC
"This report explains the uncontrolled leverage; lack of transparency, capital, and collateral requirements; speculation; interconnections among firms; and concentrations of risk in this market.",explains,report,STATIVE
OTC derivatives contributed to the crisis in three significant ways.,contributed,derivatives,DYNAMIC
"First, one type of derivativecredit default swaps (CDS)fueled the mortgage securitization pipeline.",fueled,type,DYNAMIC
CDS were sold to investors to protect against the default or decline in value of mortgage-related securities,sold,CDS,DYNAMIC
backed by risky loans.,backed,securities,STATIVE
"Companies sold protectionto the tune of $79 billion, in AIGs caseto investors in these newfangled mortgage securities, helping to launch and expand the market",sold,Companies,DYNAMIC
"and, in turn, to further fuel the housing bubble.",fuel,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Second, CDS were essential to the creation of synthetic CDOs.",were,CDS,STATIVE
These synthetic CDOs were merely bets on the performance of real mortgage-related securities.,were,CDOs,STATIVE
They amplified the losses from the collapse of the housing bubble by allowing multiple bets on the same securities,amplified,They,DYNAMIC
and helped spread them throughout the financial system.,helped,They,DYNAMIC
"Goldman Sachs alone packaged and sold $73 billion in synthetic CDOs from July 1, 2004, to May 31, 2007.",packaged,Sachs,DYNAMIC
"Synthetic CDOs created by Goldman referenced more than 3,400 mortgage securities,",referenced,CDOs,STATIVE
and 610 of them were referenced at least twice.,referenced,CDOs,DYNAMIC
This is apart from how many times these securities may have been referenced in synthetic CDOs,is,This,STATIVE
created by other firms.,created,CDOs,STATIVE
"Finally, when the housing bubble popped and crisis followed,",followed,crisis,DYNAMIC
derivatives were in the center of the storm.,were,derivatives,STATIVE
"AIG, which had not been required to put aside capital reserves",,,STATIVE
"as a cushion for the protection it was selling,",selling,it,DYNAMIC
was bailed out,bailed,AIG,DYNAMIC
when it could not meet its obligations.,meet,it,DYNAMIC
The government ultimately committed more than $180 billion because of concerns,committed,government,DYNAMIC
that AIGs collapse would trigger cascading losses throughout the global financial system.,trigger,collapse,DYNAMIC
"In addition, the existence of millions of derivatives contracts of all types between systemically important financial institutionsunseen and unknown in this unregulated marketadded to uncertainty and escalated panic,",added,existence,STATIVE
helping to precipitate government assistance to those institutions.,helping,,DYNAMIC
We conclude,conclude,We,DYNAMIC
the failures of credit rating agencies were essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction.,were,failures,STATIVE
The three credit rating agencies were key enablers of the financial meltdown.,were,agencies,STATIVE
The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval.,marketed,securities,DYNAMIC
"Investors relied on them, often blindly.",relied,Investors,STATIVE
"In some cases, they were obligated to use them,",obligated,they,STATIVE
or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them.,hinged,they,DYNAMIC
This crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies.,happened,crisis,DYNAMIC
Their ratings helped the market soar,helped,ratings,DYNAMIC
and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms.,wreaked,ratings,DYNAMIC
"In our report, you will read about the breakdowns at Moodys,",read,you,DYNAMIC
examined by the Commission as a case study.,examined,’s,DYNAMIC
"From 2000 to 2007, Moodys rated nearly 45,000 mortgage-related securities as triple-A.",rated,Moody,DYNAMIC
This compares with six private-sector companies in the United States,compares,This,STATIVE
that carried this coveted rating in early 2010.,carried,companies,STATIVE
"In 2006 alone, Moodys put its triple-A stamp of approval on 30 mortgage-related securities every working day.",put,’s,DYNAMIC
The results were disastrous:,were,results,STATIVE
83% of the mortgage securities rated triple-A that year ultimately were downgraded.,downgraded,%,DYNAMIC
"You will also read about the forces at work behind the breakdowns at Moodys,",read,You,DYNAMIC
"including the flawed computer models, the pressure from financial firms",including,,STATIVE
"that paid for the ratings, the relentless drive for market share, the lack of resources to do the job despite record profits, and the absence of meaningful public oversight.",paid,pressure,DYNAMIC
And you will see,see,you,DYNAMIC
"that without the active participation of the rating agencies, the market for mortgage- related securities could not have been what it became.",been,market,STATIVE
THERE ARE MANY COMPETING VIEWS as to the causes of this crisis.,VIEWS,COMPETING,STATIVE
"In this regard, the Commission has endeavored to address key questions",endeavored,Commission,DYNAMIC
posed to us.,posed,questions,DYNAMIC
Here we discuss three:,discuss,we,STATIVE
"capital availability and excess liquidity, the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs), and government housing policy.",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"First, as to the matter of excess liquidity: in our report, we outline monetary policies and capital flows during the years",outline,First,STATIVE
leading up to the crisis.,leading,years,STATIVE
"Low interest rates, widely available capital, and international investors seeking to put their money in real estate assets in the United States were prerequisites for the creation of a credit bubble.",were,investors,STATIVE
"Those conditions created increased risks,",created,conditions,DYNAMIC
"which should have been recognized by market participants, policy makers, and regulators.",recognized,risks,DYNAMIC
"However, it is the Commissions conclusion",is,it,STATIVE
that excess liquidity did not need to cause a crisis.,need,liquidity,DYNAMIC
It was the failures,was,It,STATIVE
outlined aboveincluding the failure to effectively rein in excesses,outlined,failures,STATIVE
in the mortgage and financial marketsthat were the principal causes of this crisis.,were,excesses,STATIVE
"Indeed, the availability of well-priced capitalboth foreign and domesticis an opportunity for economic expansion and growth if encouraged to flow in productive directions.",is,availability,STATIVE
"Second, we examined the role of the GSEs, with Fannie Mae serving as the Commissions case study in this area.",examined,we,DYNAMIC
These government-sponsored enterprises had a deeply flawed business model as publicly traded corporations with the implicit backing of and subsidies from the federal government and with a public mission.,had,enterprises,STATIVE
Their $5 trillion mortgage exposure and market position were significant.,were,exposure,STATIVE
"In 2005 and 2006, they decided to ramp up their purchase and guarantee of risky mortgages,",decided,they,DYNAMIC
just as the housing market was peaking.,peaking,market,DYNAMIC
They used their political power for decades to ward off effective regulation and oversightspending $164 million on lobbying from 1998 to 2008.,used,They,DYNAMIC
They suffered from many of the same failures of corporate governance and risk management,suffered,They,STATIVE
as the Commission discovered in other financial firms.,discovered,Commission,DYNAMIC
"Through the third quarter of 2010, the Treasury Department had provided $151 billion in financial support to keep them afloat.",provided,Department,DYNAMIC
We conclude,conclude,We,DYNAMIC
"that these two entities contributed to the crisis,",contributed,entities,DYNAMIC
but were not a primary cause.,were,,STATIVE
"Importantly, GSE mortgage securities essentially maintained their value throughout the crisis",maintained,securities,STATIVE
and did not contribute to the significant financial firm losses,contribute,securities,DYNAMIC
that were central to the financial crisis.,were,losses,STATIVE
"The GSEs participated in the expansion of subprime and other risky mortgages,",participated,GSEs,DYNAMIC
but they followed rather than led Wall Street and other lenders in the rush for fools gold.,followed,GSEs,DYNAMIC
"They purchased the highest rated non-GSE mortgage-backed securities and their participation in this market added helium to the housing balloon,",purchased,They,DYNAMIC
but their purchases never represented a majority of the market.,represented,They,STATIVE
"Those purchases represented 10.5% of non-GSE subprime mortgage-backed securities in 2001,",represented,purchases,STATIVE
"with the share rising to 40% in 2004,",rising,purchases,DYNAMIC
and falling back to 28% by 2008.,falling,purchases,DYNAMIC
They relaxed their underwriting standards to purchase or guarantee riskier loans and related securities,relaxed,They,DYNAMIC
"in order to meet stock market analysts and investors expectations for growth, to regain market share,",meet,,CANNOT_DECIDE
and to ensure generous compensation for their executives,ensure,’,CANNOT_DECIDE
and employeesjustifying their activities on the broad and sustained public policy support for homeownership.,justifying,compensation,DYNAMIC
The Commission also probed the performance of the loans,probed,Commission,DYNAMIC
purchased or guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie.,purchased,loans,DYNAMIC
"While they generated substantial losses, delinquency rates for GSE loans were substantially lower than loans",were,rates,DYNAMIC
securitized by other financial firms.,securitized,loans,STATIVE
"For example, data compiled by the Commission for a subset of borrowers with similar credit scores -- scores below 600 --",compiled,data,DYNAMIC
show,show,data,STATIVE
"that by the end of 2008, GSE mortgages were far less likely to be seriously delinquent",were,mortgages,STATIVE
than were non-GSE securitized mortgages: 6.2% versus 28.3%.,were,%,STATIVE
We also studied at length,studied,We,DYNAMIC
how the Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUDs) affordable housing goals for the GSEs affected their investment in risky mortgages.,affected,goals,DYNAMIC
Based on the evidence and interviews with dozens of individuals,Based,,STATIVE
"involved in this subject area,",involved,individuals,STATIVE
we determined,determined,we,DYNAMIC
these goals only contributed marginally to Fannies and Freddies participation in those mortgages.,contributed,goals,DYNAMIC
"Finally, as to the matter of whether government housing policies were a primary cause of the crisis",were,policies,STATIVE
": for decades, government policy has encouraged homeownership through a set of incentives, assistance programs, and mandates.",encouraged,policy,DYNAMIC
These policies were put in place,put,policies,DYNAMIC
"and promoted by several administrations and Congressesindeed,",promoted,policies,DYNAMIC
both Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush set aggressive goals to increase home- ownership.,set,policies,DYNAMIC
"In conducting our inquiry,",conducting,we,DYNAMIC
"we took a careful look at HUDs affordable housing goals,",took,we,DYNAMIC
"as noted above, and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).",noted,goals,STATIVE
The CRA was enacted in 1977 to combat redlining by banksthe practice,enacted,CRA,DYNAMIC
of denying credit to individuals and businesses in certain neighborhoods without regard to their creditworthiness.,denying,practice,CANNOT_DECIDE
"The CRA requires banks and savings and loans to lend, invest,",requires,CRA,STATIVE
and provide services to the communities,provide,banks,CANNOT_DECIDE
"from which they take deposits, consistent with bank safety and soundness.",take,they,DYNAMIC
The Commission concludes,concludes,Commission,DYNAMIC
the CRA was not a significant factor in subprime lending or the crisis.,was,CRA,STATIVE
Many subprime lenders were not subject to the CRA.,were,lenders,STATIVE
Research indicates only 6% of high-cost loansa proxy for subprime loanshad any connection to the law.,indicates,Research,STATIVE
Loans made by CRA-regulated lenders in the neighborhoods,made,Loans,DYNAMIC
in which they were required to lend,required,they,STATIVE
were half as likely to default as similar loans,were,Loans,STATIVE
made in the same neighborhoods by independent mortgage originators not subject to the law.,made,loans,DYNAMIC
"Nonetheless, we make the following observation about government housing policies",make,we,DYNAMIC
they failed in this respect,failed,they,DYNAMIC
": As a nation, we set aggressive homeownership goals with the desire to extend credit to families",set,we,DYNAMIC
previously denied access to the financial markets.,denied,families,DYNAMIC
Yet the government failed to ensure,failed,government,DYNAMIC
that the philosophy of opportunity was being matched by the practical realities on the ground.,matched,philosophy,STATIVE
Witness again,Witness,,CANNOT_DECIDE
the failure of the Federal Reserve and other regulators to rein in irresponsible lending.,rein,failure,CANNOT_DECIDE
Homeownership peaked in the spring of 2004,peaked,Homeownership,DYNAMIC
and then began to decline.,began,Homeownership,DYNAMIC
"From that point on, the talk of opportunity was tragically at odds with the reality of a financial disaster in the making.",tragically,talk,STATIVE
"WHEN THIS COMMISSION began its work 18 months ago, some imagined",imagined,some,DYNAMIC
that the events of 2008 and their consequences would be well behind us by the time,be,consequences,STATIVE
we issued this report.,issued,we,DYNAMIC
"Yet more than two years after the federal government intervened in an unprecedented manner in our financial markets, our country finds itself still grappling with the aftereffects of the calamity.",finds,country,DYNAMIC
"Our financial system is, in many respects, still unchanged from what existed on the eve of the crisis.",is,system,STATIVE
"Indeed, in the wake of the crisis, the U.S. financial sector is now more concentrated than ever in the hands of a few large, systemically significant institutions.",is,sector,STATIVE
"While we have not been charged with making policy recommendations, the very purpose of our report has been to take stock of what happened",been,purpose,DYNAMIC
so we can plot a new course.,plot,we,DYNAMIC
"In our inquiry, we found dramatic breakdowns of corporate governance, profound lapses in regulatory oversight, and near fatal flaws in our financial system.",found,we,DYNAMIC
We also found,found,We,DYNAMIC
that a series of choices and actions led us toward a catastrophe,led,series,DYNAMIC
for which we were ill prepared.,prepared,we,STATIVE
These are serious matters,are,These,STATIVE
"that must be addressed and resolved to restore faith in our financial markets, to avoid the next crisis,",addressed,matters,DYNAMIC
and to rebuild a system of capital,rebuild,,CANNOT_DECIDE
that provides the foundation for a new era of broadly shared prosperity.,provides,system,STATIVE
The greatest tragedy would be to accept the refrain,be,tragedy,STATIVE
that no one could have seen,seen,one,DYNAMIC
this coming and thus nothing could have been done.,done,one,DYNAMIC
"If we accept this notion,",accept,we,DYNAMIC
it will happen again.,happen,it,DYNAMIC
This report should not be viewed as the end of the nations examination of this crisis.,viewed,report,DYNAMIC
"There is still much to learn,",is,,STATIVE
"much to investigate,",investigate,,CANNOT_DECIDE
