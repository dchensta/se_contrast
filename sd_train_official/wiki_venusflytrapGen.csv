"The Venus flytrap (also Venus's flytrap or Venus' flytrap), Dionaea muscipula, is a carnivorous plant native to subtropical wetlands on the East Coast of the United States.",is,flytrap,STATIVE
It catches its preychiefly insects and arachnids with a trapping structure,catches,It,DYNAMIC
formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves,formed,structure,DYNAMIC
and is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces.,triggered,It,DYNAMIC
"When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contacts a hair, the trap closes",closes,trap,DYNAMIC
if a different hair is contacted within twenty seconds of the first strike.,contacted,hair,DYNAMIC
The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against a waste of energy in trapping objects with no nutritional value.,serves,requirement,DYNAMIC
"Dionaea is a monotypic genus closely related to the waterwheel plant and sundews,",is,Dionaea,STATIVE
all of which belong to the family Droseraceae.,belong,of,STATIVE
==Description==,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The Venus flytrap is a small plant,is,=,STATIVE
"whose structure can be described as a rosette of four to seven leaves,",described,structure,STATIVE
which arise from a short subterranean stem,arise,leaves,DYNAMIC
that is actually a bulb-like object.,is,stem,STATIVE
"Each stem reaches a maximum size of about three to ten centimeters, depending on the time of year;",reaches,stem,DYNAMIC
longer leaves with robust traps are usually formed after flowering.,formed,leaves,DYNAMIC
Flytraps that have more than 7 leaves are colonies,are,Flytraps,STATIVE
formed by rosettes,formed,colonies,DYNAMIC
that have divided beneath the ground.,divided,rosettes,DYNAMIC
The leaf blade is divided into two regions:,divided,blade,STATIVE
"a flat, heart-shaped photosynthesis-capable petiole, and a pair of terminal lobes hinged at the midrib, forming the trap",forming,petiole,STATIVE
which is the true leaf.,is,trap,STATIVE
The upper surface of these lobes contains red anthocyanin pigments and its edges secrete mucilage.,contains,surface,STATIVE
"The lobes exhibit rapid plant movements, snapping shut",exhibit,lobes,STATIVE
when stimulated by prey.,stimulated,,DYNAMIC
The trapping mechanism is tripped,tripped,mechanism,DYNAMIC
when prey contacts one of the three hair-like trichomes,prey,,DYNAMIC
that are found on the upper surface of each of the lobes.,found,trichomes,STATIVE
The trapping mechanism is so specialized,is,mechanism,STATIVE
that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli such as falling raindrops;,distinguish,it,DYNAMIC
two trigger hairs must be touched in succession within 20 seconds of each other or one hair,touched,hairs,DYNAMIC
"touched twice in rapid succession, whereupon",touched,seconds,DYNAMIC
the lobes of the trap will snap shut in about one-tenth of a second.,shut,lobes,DYNAMIC
"The edges of the lobes are fringed by stiff hair-like protrusions or cilia,",fringed,edges,STATIVE
which mesh together,mesh,cilia,DYNAMIC
and prevent large prey from escaping.,prevent,protrusions,DYNAMIC
"(These protrusions, and the trigger hairs, also known as sensitive hairs, are probably homologous with the tentacles found in this plants close relatives, the sundews.)",protrusions,These,STATIVE
Scientists have concluded,concluded,Scientists,DYNAMIC
"that the Venus flytrap is closely related to Drosera (sundews),",related,flytrap,STATIVE
and that the snap trap evolved from a fly-paper trap similar to that of Drosera.,evolved,flytrap,DYNAMIC
"The holes in the meshwork allow small prey to escape,",allow,holes,DYNAMIC
presumably because the benefit that would be obtained from them would be less than the cost of digesting them.,be,benefit,STATIVE
"If the prey is too small and escapes, the trap will reopen within 12 hours.",reopen,trap,DYNAMIC
"If the prey moves around in the trap,",moves,prey,DYNAMIC
it tightens and digestion begins more quickly.,tightens,it,DYNAMIC
"Speed of closing can vary depending on the amount of humidity, light, size of prey, and general growing conditions.",vary,Speed,STATIVE
The speed with which traps close can be used as an indicator of a plant's general health.,used,speed,DYNAMIC
Venus flytraps are not as humidity-dependent,are,plants,STATIVE
"as are some other carnivorous plants, such as Nepenthes, Cephalotus, most Heliamphora, and some Drosera.",are,,STATIVE
The Venus flytrap exhibits variations in petiole shape and length,exhibits,flytrap,STATIVE
and whether the leaf lies flat on the ground,lies,exhibits,STATIVE
or extends up at an angle of about 4060 degrees.,extends,leaf,DYNAMIC
"The four major forms are: 'typica', the most common, with broad decumbent petioles; 'erecta', with leaves at a 45-degree angle; 'linearis', with narrow petioles and leaves at 45 degrees; and 'filiformis', with extremely narrow or linear petioles.",are,forms,STATIVE
"Except for 'filiformis', all of these can be stages in leaf production of any plant depending on season",be,all,STATIVE
"(decumbent in summer versus short versus semi-erect in spring), length of photoperiod (long petioles in spring versus short in summer), and intensity of light (wide petioles in low light intensity versus narrow in brighter light).",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"When grown from seed, plants take around four to five years to reach maturity",take,plants,STATIVE
and will live for 20 to 30 years,live,plants,STATIVE
if cultivated in the right conditions.,cultivated,,DYNAMIC
==Etymology==,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"The plant's common name refers to Venus, the Roman goddess of love.",refers,=,STATIVE
"The genus name, Dionaea (""daughter of Dione""),",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"refers to the Greek goddess Aphrodite,",refers,name,STATIVE
"while the species name, muscipula is Latin for ""mousetrap"".",is,name,STATIVE
"Historically, the plant was also known by the slang term ""tipitiwitchet"" or ""tippity twitchet"", possibly an oblique reference to the plant's resemblance to human female genitalia.",possibly,Historically,STATIVE
==Carnivory==,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
===Prey selectivity===,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Most carnivorous plants selectively feed on specific prey.,feed,plants,DYNAMIC
This selection is due to the available prey and the type of trap,is,selection,STATIVE
used by the organism.,used,type,DYNAMIC
"With the Venus flytrap, prey is limited to beetles, spiders and other crawling arthropods.",limited,prey,STATIVE
"In fact, the Dionaea diet is 33% ants, 30% spiders, 10% beetles, and 10% grasshoppers, with fewer than 5%",is,diet,STATIVE
flying insects.,flying,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Given that Dionaea evolved from an ancestral form of Drosera (carnivorous plants,Given,becomes,DYNAMIC
that use a sticky trap instead of a snap trap),use,plants,DYNAMIC
the reason for this evolutionary branching becomes clear.,becomes,reason,DYNAMIC
"Whilst Drosera consume smaller, aerial insects,",consume,Drosera,DYNAMIC
Dionaea consume larger terrestrial bugs.,consume,Dionaea,DYNAMIC
"From these larger bugs, Dionaea are able to extract more nutrients.",are,Dionaea,STATIVE
This gives Dionaea an evolutionary advantage over their ancestral sticky trap form.,gives,This,STATIVE
