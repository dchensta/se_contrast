Introduction,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Older adults are frequently counseled to lose weight,",,,DYNAMIC
even though there is little evidence,,,STATIVE
that overweight is associated with increased mortality in those over age 65.,,,STATIVE
Six large controlled population-based studies of non-smoking older adults have investigated the association between body mass index,,,DYNAMIC
"(BMI) and mortality,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
controlling for relevant covariates [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] .,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"All studies found excess risk for persons with very low BMI,",,,DYNAMIC
but that persons with moderately high BMI had little or no extra risk except in certain small subsets.,,,STATIVE
A review of 13 studies of older adults drew similar conclusions [ 7 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
Many healthy older adults report gradual weight gain throughout adult life.,,,DYNAMIC
It may be that a small amount of gradual weight gain is normative and associated with the most robust health as we age.,,,STATIVE
It has been suggested,,,DYNAMIC
that weight standards be adjusted upwards for age [ 8 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
"Such recommendations remain controversial, however,",,,STATIVE
"because the number of studies of older persons is fairly small,",,,STATIVE
and because few studies have examined the relation of BMI to quality of life or years of healthy life (YHL) in the elderly [ 9 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
"In older adults, risk factors may have a greater effect on health than on mortality.",,,STATIVE
"If so, then behavior change trials of weight modification might be more successful",,,STATIVE
"if they were evaluated on improved health, rather than on decreased mortality.",,,DYNAMIC
Clinical trials powered to detect differences in YHL would often require fewer subjects,,,STATIVE
than trials to detect survival differences or cardiovascular events [ 10 ] .,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
In this paper we study,,,STATIVE
"whether BMI at baseline is associated with living longer, and/or with more years of being healthy, in a cohort of older adults",,,STATIVE
"for whom risk factors, subclinical disease, and morbidity are well characterized.",,,STATIVE
The goal is to determine,,,STATIVE
"whether analyses based on years of life (YOL) or on YHL would provide substantively different results,",,,DYNAMIC
and which measure would yield more powerful evaluations of weight modification interventions in older adults.,,,DYNAMIC
Materials and methods,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Study design: The Cardiovascular Health Study,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS),,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"is a population-based longitudinal study of 5,888 adults",,,STATIVE
aged 65 and older at baseline [ 11 ] .,,,STATIVE
Subjects were recruited from a random sample of the Medicare eligibility lists in four US counties.,,,DYNAMIC
Extensive baseline data were collected for all subjects,,,DYNAMIC
"using a baseline home interview, an annual mail questionnaire, and annual clinic examinations.",,,DYNAMIC
Additional information was collected in a brief telephone interview 6 months after each scheduled visit.,,,DYNAMIC
"Two cohorts were followed, one with 7 years of follow-up",,,DYNAMIC
(n,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"= 5,201) and the second (all African American, n =",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
687) with 4 years of follow-up to date.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Data collection began in 1989,",,,DYNAMIC
and follow-up is virtually complete for all surviving subjects [ 12 ] .,,,STATIVE
Body mass index,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
BMI was calculated,,,DYNAMIC
as measured weight in kilograms,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
divided by the square of measured height in meters.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
A report from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute classifies normal weight,,,STATIVE
(without reference to age) as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9; overweight as 25 to 29.9; and obesity as 30.0 and higher [ 13 ] .,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"We consider separately the group with BMI between 18.5 and 20,",,,STATIVE
which was associated with lower survival in studies,,,STATIVE
cited above.,,,STATIVE
Years of life and years of healthy life,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
YOL is the number of years,,,STATIVE
that a person lived in the 7 years after baseline.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
YHL is the number of years,,,STATIVE
"in which the person was 'healthy',",,,STATIVE
"and is similar in concept to quality-adjusted life-years, healthy year equivalents, or active life expectancy [ 14 ] .",,,STATIVE
"We based YHL on self-rated health (is your health excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?)",,,STATIVE
(EVGFP) which was collected every 6 months.,,,DYNAMIC
"EVGFP is a simple but well-known measure,",,,STATIVE
"which has been studied in detail [ 15 16 ] ,",,,DYNAMIC
and is predictive of health events in many studies [ 17 ] .,,,STATIVE
"Because we are examining health status over time,",,,DYNAMIC
"we added a sixth health state, dead.",,,DYNAMIC
Data were available about 93% of the time.,,,STATIVE
We used linear interpolation to estimate missing data,,,DYNAMIC
"when there were known values before and after the missing value,",,,STATIVE
bringing the percent complete to 95% [ 18 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
For this analysis we defined YHL as the number of years,,,DYNAMIC
"(of 7) in which a person reported excellent, very good, or good health",,,DYNAMIC
(were 'healthy').,,,STATIVE
YHL ranges from 0,,,STATIVE
"(for persons who were never in excellent, very good, or good health) to 7 years (for persons",,,STATIVE
who were healthy throughout).,,,STATIVE
"Since people reported their health every 6 months, YHL has a reasonably continuous distribution.",,,DYNAMIC
"A drawback of this simple definition of 'healthy' is that it does not distinguish between fair or poor health and death,",,,STATIVE
since all are considered 'not healthy'.,,,STATIVE
"We also used an alternative approach,",,,DYNAMIC
which assigns a different value to each level of EVGFP [ 19 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
"Preliminary results were similar for the two approaches, however,",,,STATIVE
and we report results,,,DYNAMIC
using only the simpler definition.,,,DYNAMIC
"The calculations had to be modified to include the 438 persons in the second African American cohort,",,,DYNAMIC
who have been followed only 4 years to date.,,,DYNAMIC
"For those persons, and for 70 persons in the first cohort who did not have complete data,",,,STATIVE
"we estimated the last 4 years of YOL and YHL from their age, sex, and health at the end of 3 years,",,,DYNAMIC
using validated methods,,,DYNAMIC
presented elsewhere [ 20 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
That article showed,,,DYNAMIC
that estimated 4-year YOL and YHL were unbiased for the African American cohort.,,,STATIVE
In the primary analysis we used observed 7-year YOL and YHL,,,DYNAMIC
"when they were available,",,,STATIVE
and observed 3-year YOL and YHL plus 4-year estimated YOL and YHL,,,DYNAMIC
when they were not (about 10% of the sample).,,,STATIVE
We performed all analyses,,,DYNAMIC
"with and without the persons who had partially estimated data, to ensure",,,STATIVE
that the estimation had not distorted the findings.,,,DYNAMIC
Covariates,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The goal is to examine the association of YOL and YHL with BMI.,,,STATIVE
To adjust for possible confounding,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
we chose baseline covariates,,,DYNAMIC
"that were prevalent in the elderly, related to mortality and morbidity in previous studies, and likely to be related to BMI.",,,STATIVE
"Self-reported covariates include age, gender, smoking (never or former), history of arthritis, cancer, diabetes, fair or poor self-rated health status, limitations in activities of daily living or in instrumental activities of daily living, and 10 pounds or more unintended weight loss in the year before baseline.",,,STATIVE
"Clinical covariates include hypertension, cardiovascular disease",,,STATIVE
"(prevalent heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, or cerebrovascular disease), maximum thickness of the internal carotid artery, depression (CESD score), serum albumin, serum cholesterol, and serum creatinine.",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
These measures are explained in more detail elsewhere [ 21 22 23 24 ] .,,,STATIVE
"We excluded 697 current smokers and 313 others with incomplete covariate data,",,,DYNAMIC
"leaving 4,878 persons on whom this analysis is based.",,,STATIVE
Analysis,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
All analyses were performed separately for men and women.,,,DYNAMIC
"We calculated two sets of adjusted values,",,,DYNAMIC
as follows.,,,STATIVE
"We regressed YOL and YHL first on age, age squared, race, and smoking history",,,DYNAMIC
"(former or never), and second on all of the covariates",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
listed above.,,,STATIVE
We calculated adjusted YOL as a person's observed YOL,,,DYNAMIC
minus predicted YOL (from the regression) plus the mean YOL (6.52 years for women or 6.06 for men).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"That is, a person's adjusted YOL is his residual from the regression plus the grand mean.",,,STATIVE
"The mean of this new variable, for a group of subjects, is the adjusted mean YOL for that group.",,,STATIVE
Adjusted YHL was calculated in a similar manner.,,,DYNAMIC
"We calculated two sets of adjusted variables because of the possibility of 'over-adjustment',",,,DYNAMIC
controlling inappropriately for factors (such as diabetes),,,STATIVE
which may have been causally affected by the person's weight.,,,DYNAMIC
"We plotted mean adjusted YOL and YHL against BMI,",,,DYNAMIC
and tested for difference among BMI groups,,,DYNAMIC
using confidence intervals or analysis of variance.,,,DYNAMIC
"Finally we calculated the effect size for each measure,",,,DYNAMIC
comparing each BMI subgroup to the 'normal' group.,,,DYNAMIC
The effect size is the difference in mean YOL (or YHL) in two groups,,,STATIVE
divided by their common standard deviation.,,,STATIVE
"Since the sample size required to detect an effect of this magnitude is proportional to the inverse of the squared effect size, large effect sizes are desirable.",,,STATIVE
Results,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Table 1shows the distribution of key variables by sex and race.,,,STATIVE
Mean age at baseline was 73.1,,,STATIVE
and about two thirds of the men and a third of the women were former smokers.,,,STATIVE
Black women had a higher mean BMI and higher percent obese,,,STATIVE
(BMI  30) than the other three groups.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Black men were most likely to have unintentionally lost more than 10 pounds in the past year;,,,STATIVE
white women were least likely.,,,STATIVE
"About 78% of the subjects were healthy at baseline,",,,STATIVE
declining to 57% at the end of 7 years;,,,DYNAMIC
20% had died (data,,,DYNAMIC
not shown).,,,STATIVE
Of the 22% who were unhealthy (fair or poor),,,STATIVE
"at baseline, about 24% were healthy 7 years later.",,,STATIVE
"There was thus substantial change in EVGFP over time, in both directions.",,,STATIVE
Table 1shows the mean YOL and YHL,,,STATIVE
"(calculated from EVGFP) in the first seven years of the study,",,,DYNAMIC
adjusted to age 73.,,,STATIVE
"For example, black women averaged 6.3 YOL, but only 4.2 YHL of a maximum possible 7.",,,STATIVE
"We calculated some additional descriptive statistics,",,,DYNAMIC
shown in the final two lines:,,,STATIVE
years of unhealthy life (YOL minus YHL) and years lost to death (7 minus YOL).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
White women had the most YHL and black men the fewest;,,,STATIVE
"black women had the most years of unhealthy life, and white men the fewest;",,,STATIVE
black men lost the most years to death,,,DYNAMIC
(1.3 out of 7) while white women lost only 0.4 years.,,,DYNAMIC
"For blacks, about 68% of their YOL were healthy",,,STATIVE
"(YHL/YOL, not shown);",,,STATIVE
"for whites, about 75% were healthy.",,,STATIVE
"Among whites, the gender differences in Table 1were statistically significant (p <.05) except for BMI and unintended weight loss.",,,STATIVE
"Among blacks, gender differences were significant except for 10 pounds unintended weight loss and weight loss since age 50.",,,STATIVE
"Among males, there were significant differences between black and white for BMI, unintended weight loss, YOL, YHL, years of unhealthy life, and years",,,STATIVE
lost to death.,,,STATIVE
Whites in the sample had higher income and education,,,STATIVE
(data not shown).,,,STATIVE
"After adjusting for income and education, as well as age and former smoking, the difference in BMI was no longer statistically significant.",,,STATIVE
"Among females, blacks and whites differed significantly on BMI, BMI>30, weight loss since age 50, YOL, YHL, years of unhealthy life, and years",,,STATIVE
lost to death.,,,STATIVE
"After adjustment for income and education, the difference in weight loss since age 50 was no longer significant.",,,STATIVE
"Blacks had significantly lower YOL and YHL than whites after adjustment for age,",,,STATIVE
but the difference disappeared after adjustment for the entire set of health-related baseline covariates,,,DYNAMIC
(analyses not shown).,,,STATIVE
We next examined the relationship of BMI to YOL and YHL.,,,DYNAMIC
"Table 2presents the mean values of YOL and YHL,",,,STATIVE
"adjusted for age, race, and previous smoking (columns 1 and 3),",,,STATIVE
and also adjusted for the entire set of covariates (columns 2 and 4).,,,STATIVE
"For example, YOL for women, adjusted for age, race, and smoking, averaged 6.0 years for women with a baseline BMI below 18.5,",,,STATIVE
but averaged 6.6 years for women with a BMI from 25 to 29.9.,,,STATIVE
"The second column, which shows results",,,STATIVE
"adjusted for all covariates,",,,STATIVE
"is not very different (the only discrepancy is for men with BMI < 18.5, a category",,,STATIVE
containing only 14 men).,,,STATIVE
Adjustment for extensive covariates also made little difference for YHL (columns 3 and 4).,,,DYNAMIC
"Subsequent analyses are adjusted only for age, race, and former smoking.",,,STATIVE
"As mentioned above,",,,STATIVE
the group with BMI from 18.5 to 20 would be considered ',,,DYNAMIC
"normal' by the NHLBI guidelines, but had lower YOL and YHL than those with 20-24.9 in all comparisons.",,,STATIVE
"For this reason, and to increase sample size for those with low BMI,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"we combined the two lower categories,",,,DYNAMIC
defining underweight as a BMI under 20.,,,STATIVE
Figure 1is a plot of adjusted YOL and YHL by sex and BMI.,,,STATIVE
For each BMI category the mean and its 95% confidence interval are plotted.,,,STATIVE
"Categories whose confidence intervals do not overlap,",,,STATIVE
"or overlap only slightly, are significantly different.",,,STATIVE
The bars are slightly offset to permit all error bars to be seen.,,,STATIVE
"YOL for women (the uppermost curve on Figure 1) averaged about 6.5 out of 7 years,",,,STATIVE
and showed no evident association between BMI and YOL for BMI above 20.,,,STATIVE
Underweight women averaged about .25 fewer YOL than other women,,,STATIVE
(p < .05 compared with normal group).,,,STATIVE
"Underweight men also had lower YOL,",,,STATIVE
"but this group was not significantly different from the normal group, in part because of low sample size.",,,STATIVE
"Men classified as normal, overweight or obese all had about the same YOL.",,,STATIVE
The lowermost two lines in Figure 1show mean YHL for women and men.,,,STATIVE
Women who were normal or overweight averaged about 4.9 YHL.,,,STATIVE
"The YHL for underweight or obese women was about 4.5 years,",,,STATIVE
which was significantly lower than the normal group.,,,STATIVE
"The relationship of BMI to YHL for men is similar,",,,STATIVE
but differences among BMI groups were not statistically significant.,,,STATIVE
"YHL was significantly higher for women than for men in the normal and overweight groups,",,,STATIVE
but the sexes had similar YHL in the underweight and obese groups.,,,STATIVE
We next present the effect size for comparing each group to the normal BMI group.,,,STATIVE
"The effect sizes are shown in Table 3, with the significance results of the associated t-tests for the differences in means of the two groups",,,STATIVE
being compared.,,,STATIVE
"For example, underweight women averaged 4.50 YHL",,,STATIVE
"compared to 4.92 for normal women,",,,STATIVE
and the common standard deviation was 1.44.,,,STATIVE
The effect size is thus (4.92-4.50)/1.44 = .29.,,,STATIVE
"The two groups had significantly different YHL,",,,STATIVE
implying,,,STATIVE
that the effect size is also significantly greater than zero.,,,STATIVE
A clinical trial of a treatment to help underweight women achieve normal weight,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
(presumably by addressing the underlying cause),,,CANNOT_DECIDE
could be expected to have 80% power with N,,,STATIVE
= (1.96+.84) 2/.29 2=,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"about 93 women per treatment arm,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
if 7-year YHL were the outcome measure.,,,STATIVE
"The biggest effect sizes are in the first row,",,,STATIVE
comparing underweight to normal.,,,STATIVE
"YHL and YOL have similar effect sizes for women,",,,STATIVE
and are significantly different from zero.,,,STATIVE
"The effect sizes are not significantly different from zero for men,",,,STATIVE
in part because there were only 42 men in the underweight category.,,,STATIVE
"The effect size comparing overweight to normal yielded small, non-significant effect sizes, with inconsistent signs,",,,DYNAMIC
suggesting,,,STATIVE
extremely large sample sizes would be needed.,,,STATIVE
"For comparing obese to normal, only YHL for women showed a large and significant effect size.",,,DYNAMIC
"Thus, an intervention to improve the health of underweight women to that of their normal weight peers could be performed using either YHL or YOL as the outcome variable.",,,DYNAMIC
"Trials to make obese women comparable to normal women could be evaluated using YHL, but not YOL.",,,DYNAMIC
Trials to improve the health of the other groups to that of the normals would probably be fruitless,,,STATIVE
since there is no evidence,,,STATIVE
that being overweight,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
(for men or women) or obese (for men),,,CANNOT_DECIDE
affects YOL or YHL.,,,DYNAMIC
"As mentioned above,",,,STATIVE
we repeated these analyses,,,DYNAMIC
"excluding the persons with partially estimated data,",,,DYNAMIC
and using two different ways of coding YHL.,,,DYNAMIC
The only substantive change was that some of the differences between blacks and whites,,,STATIVE
"shown in Table 1were no longer statistically significant, due to a smaller sample size.",,,STATIVE
Discussion,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Optimal weight and overweight,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Recent studies have defined obesity without reference to age [ 6 13 30 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
Andres et al proposed a desirable BMI of 24-30 for persons,,,DYNAMIC
aged 60 to 69 [ 8 ] .,,,STATIVE
Allison et al [ 31 ] proposed 27-30 for older men and 30-35 for older women.,,,DYNAMIC
"In Figure 1, the overweight (as opposed to the obese)",,,STATIVE
"are no different from those of normal weight,",,,STATIVE
suggesting,,,STATIVE
that these two categories could be combined for older adults.,,,DYNAMIC
"Since future improvements in life expectancy may be limited [ 32 ] , the greatest advances may be made by improving people's YHL.",,,STATIVE
This suggests,,,STATIVE
that the development of future guidelines should take YHL or other measures of quality of life into account.,,,DYNAMIC
Implications for clinical trials,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Based on these findings, trials to address obesity in older women could be efficient",,,STATIVE
if YHL (but not YOL),,,CANNOT_DECIDE
was the outcome measure.,,,STATIVE
"That is, women",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"who changed from being obese to being normal would likely show changes in YHL, but not YOL.",,,STATIVE
Clinical trials of weight modification interventions for older adults who were merely overweight would appear to be fruitless,,,STATIVE
since the interventions would probably not have a direct effect on either YOL or YHL.,,,STATIVE
Weight or weight change are sometimes used as the outcome in evaluations of interventions such as diet or exercise programs.,,,DYNAMIC
The fact that weight is not associated in a consistent way,,,STATIVE
with health suggests,,,STATIVE
that such evaluations should be considered,,,STATIVE
critically when older adults are the subjects.,,,STATIVE
"This is particularly important in the light of recent findings,",,,STATIVE
which found,,,DYNAMIC
that interventions such as weight-loss drugs may be harmful [ 33 34 ] .,,,STATIVE
"For older adults, the risks associated with higher weight are especially unclear,",,,STATIVE
and the optimal outcome for a trial of weight loss in older adults requires specific attention to improved health and mortality.,,,STATIVE
"Interestingly, the strongest health relationships were found for underweight older adults.",,,DYNAMIC
Clinical trials whose objective was to make the underweight as healthy as their normal-weight peers,,,STATIVE
(presumably by addressing the underlying conditions,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
that caused the low weight),,,DYNAMIC
could be performed efficiently,,,DYNAMIC
using either YOL or YHL as the outcome measure.,,,DYNAMIC
Both YOL and YHL would be clinically significant in this patient group.,,,STATIVE
Potential limitations,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
CHS participants were somewhat healthier than the average older adult;,,,STATIVE
"however, adjustment for detailed covariates made little difference in the findings.",,,DYNAMIC
"We estimated the last four years of health data for about 10% of the sample,",,,DYNAMIC
but results with and without this group were similar.,,,STATIVE
"Analysis of mean YOL instead of the more traditional survival analysis survival analysis was appropriate here,",,,STATIVE
since virtually no persons were lost to follow-up.,,,DYNAMIC
"Biases caused by over-adjustment are probably not large,",,,STATIVE
since the findings were not sensitive to the number of variables,,,STATIVE
adjusted for.,,,STATIVE
These results are for a 7-year follow-up.,,,STATIVE
The relative superiority of YHL to YOL would probably hold in trials with shorter follow-up.,,,DYNAMIC
"The effect sizes in Table 3might also be appropriate in shorter trials,",,,STATIVE
since lengthy trials often add little information [ 10 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
"EVGFP, on which YHL was based,",,,STATIVE
might have missed some effects of obesity on risk factors for future health.,,,DYNAMIC
A person who is depressed because of a poor self-image,,,STATIVE
related to obesity,,,STATIVE
or who has osteo-arthritis,,,STATIVE
"related to obesity and limits to activities to successfully avoid pain would surely have worse EVGFP than others,",,,STATIVE
based on results from many studies.,,,STATIVE
"However, health measures designed specifically to measure those conditions might be more sensitive to change in weight than EVGFP.",,,STATIVE
"If YHL were based on such measures, the superiority of YHL to YOL would likely be even greater than that",,,STATIVE
shown here.,,,STATIVE
"These more sensitive measures might also have detected differences between the overweight and normal weight persons,",,,DYNAMIC
but we think,,,STATIVE
this is unlikely given the absence of any differences in EVGFP.,,,STATIVE
Conclusion,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Recommendations for desirable weight have been criticized for emphasizing mortality rather than health.,,,DYNAMIC
We found associations between YHL and obesity,,,DYNAMIC
"that were not present in the mortality analysis,",,,STATIVE
suggesting,,,STATIVE
"that YHL may be a more sensitive measure of the burden of obesity in older adults, especially for women.",,,STATIVE
Future efforts to determine desirable weight guidelines should include measures of YHL.,,,STATIVE
"Using either YOL or YHL, however,",,,DYNAMIC
we found no excess risk for older adults,,,DYNAMIC
who would be classified as 'overweight' by the NHLBI guidelines.,,,STATIVE
This suggests using YHL as the outcome measure in clinical trials,,,STATIVE
"involving obese or underweight older adults, and discouraging trials that address older adults",,,STATIVE
who are merely overweight.,,,STATIVE
