"Historically, the constraint of dominant concern has been determinism of some variety",been,so,STATIVE
"(such as logical, nomological, or theological), so the most prominent common positions are named for the relation",named,positions,DYNAMIC
they hold to exist between free will and determinism.,hold,they,STATIVE
"Those who define free will as freedom from determinism are called incompatibilists,",called,Those,STATIVE
as they hold determinism to be incompatible with free will.,hold,they,STATIVE
"The two main incompatibilist positions are metaphysical libertarianism, the claim",are,positions,STATIVE
"that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible; and hard determinism,",is,determinism,STATIVE

Hard incompatibilism posits,posits,incompatibilism,STATIVE
"that indeterminism is also incompatible with free will,",is,indeterminism,STATIVE

"Those who define free will otherwise,",define,Those,DYNAMIC

"that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, a process",involves,choice,STATIVE
