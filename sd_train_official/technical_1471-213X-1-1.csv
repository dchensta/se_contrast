Background,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD),,,CANNOT_DECIDE
catalyzes the formation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter -amino butyric acid (GABA) from glutamate.,,,DYNAMIC
"In mammals, the two isoforms of this enzyme, GAD67 and GAD65, are expressed from two separate genes, Gad1 and Gad2 respectively [ 1, 2, 3].",,,DYNAMIC
GABA signaling plays several roles in neuronal development.,,,STATIVE
"Early in CNS development, GABA can modulate neuron progenitor proliferation as well as neuron migration, survival and differentiation [ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].",,,DYNAMIC
In some classes of neural progenitors GABA stimulates these processes,,,DYNAMIC
while in others it has an antagonistic activity.,,,STATIVE
"For example, recent work has demonstrated",,,DYNAMIC
that GABA acts in the developing neocortex to stimulate the proliferation of progenitors in the ventricular zone,,,DYNAMIC
while inhibiting the proliferation of progenitors in the subventricular zone [ 14].,,,DYNAMIC
"Later, during postnatal development, normal GABAergic input is required for activity-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex",,,STATIVE
"as shown in the Gad2 knockout mouse [ 15, 16].",,,STATIVE
"In addition to these functions in the developing CNS, GABA signaling is also required for the normal development of non-neural tissues.",,,STATIVE
"Targeted mutations of the Gad1 gene lead to defective development of the secondary palate [ 17, 18].",,,DYNAMIC
The cleft palate phenotype of the Gad1 mutants suggests the involvement of GABA-mediated signals in the normal development and differentiation of a structure,,,STATIVE
derived from the oral epithelium and neural crest ecto-mesenchyme.,,,STATIVE
This conclusion is further supported by the similar cleft,,,STATIVE
"palate defect seen in mice with a deletion or targeted mutation in the 3 subunit of the GABA A receptor [ 19, 20, 21, 22].",,,DYNAMIC
"This intriguing genetic evidence indicates a role for GABA-mediated signaling in the development of a non-neural structure, the secondary palate.",,,STATIVE
The potential for this pathway to be involved in the early development of additional non-neural tissues has not yet been thoroughly explored [ 23].,,,DYNAMIC
"To address this question,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
we surveyed Gad1 transcript distribution in the non-CNS tissues of the embryo.,,,DYNAMIC
"Using a whole mount in situ hybridization approach,",,,DYNAMIC
we found,,,DYNAMIC
that Gad1 is indeed expressed in a number of different regions and tissues.,,,DYNAMIC
A notable feature of this expression pattern is that Gad1 transcripts accumulate in the specialized ectodermal structures,,,STATIVE
that are involved in the formation of the mystacial vibrissae and in limb outgrowth.,,,STATIVE
"These specialized ectodermal tissues are known to be sources of developmental signals [ 24, 25, 26].",,,STATIVE
"In addition, transcripts are expressed in the mesenchymal stem cell population of the tailbud and in the pharyngeal endoderm and mesenchyme.",,,DYNAMIC
The expression patterns show,,,STATIVE
that Gad1 is expressed in several non-CNS structures,,,DYNAMIC
that are derived from each of the three germ layers of the embryo.,,,STATIVE
Results,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The mouse Gad1 gene is widely expressed in the embryonic central nervous system [ 27].,,,DYNAMIC
"To define additional sites of expression outside of the CNS,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
we analyzed the distribution of Gad1 transcripts in E8.5 to E14.5 mouse embryos by whole mount in situ hybridization.,,,DYNAMIC
Gad1 transcripts were not detected in E8.5 day embryos,,,DYNAMIC
(data not shown).,,,STATIVE
At E9.0 Gad1 was readily detected in the tailbud (figure 1A).,,,DYNAMIC
Expression in the tail continued through E12.5,,,STATIVE
and was undetectable by E13.5,,,STATIVE
"(figure 1B,C,Dand data not shown), a period corresponding to secondary body axis formation in the mouse embryo [ 28].",,,STATIVE
Examination of sections from an E9.5 embryo revealed a high level of Gad1 expression throughout the mesenchyme and neural epithelium in the caudal portion of the tailbud (figure 1F).,,,DYNAMIC
No transcripts were detected in the surface ectoderm,,,DYNAMIC
surrounding the tailbud mesenchyme (figure 1F).,,,STATIVE
"At more cranial levels within the tail, expression was localized to paraxial mesoderm, ventral neural tube, notochord and cells of the dorsal hindgut (figure 1E).",,,STATIVE
"In the paraxial mesoderm, the highest expression levels were also localized ventrally,",,,STATIVE
adjacent to the notochord (figure 1E).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"In the pharyngeal region of E9.5 embryos, Gad1 RNA was detected in and around the second, third and fourth pharyngeal pouches (figure 2A).",,,DYNAMIC
Sections through the third pouch confirmed the presence of Gad1 expression in the pouch endoderm,,,DYNAMIC
(data not shown).,,,STATIVE
Expression was particularly strong in the dorsal portion of this pouch (figure 2B).,,,STATIVE
The additional diffuse staining appeared to be in the pharyngeal mesenchyme (figure 2B).,,,STATIVE
The expression in the pharyngeal region was very transient;,,,STATIVE
"transcripts were easily detected at E9.5, but only faintly at E9.0",,,DYNAMIC
and were not detectable by E10.5.,,,STATIVE
"In the limb buds, Gad1 RNA was detected from E9.0 to E11.5 (figure 3A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H).",,,DYNAMIC
Transcripts were initially expressed in the pre-apical ectodermal ridge,,,DYNAMIC
"(pre-AER) at E9.5 (figure 3A,B)",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
and by E10.5 were seen in the definitive AER of the forelimb (figure 3D).,,,DYNAMIC
At E10.5 Gad1 was expressed in a diffuse stripe in the forelimb,,,DYNAMIC
(figure 3D) while in the hindlimb expression was only detected in the apical ectoderm (figure 3E).,,,DYNAMIC
By E11.5 forelimb AER expression was fading,,,DYNAMIC
"and expression was seen in a diffuse stripe in the proximal forelimb and a diffuse crescent in the proximal hindlimb (figure 3G,H).",,,DYNAMIC
The earlier activation of Gad1 in the forelimb reflects the normal temporal order of events in limb development.,,,STATIVE
Sections indicate,,,STATIVE
that the expression within the limb buds was in surface ectoderm and adjacent mesenchyme,,,STATIVE
(data not shown).,,,STATIVE
Gad1 RNA was not detected in the limbs by whole mount in situ hybridization after E11.5.,,,DYNAMIC
"A dynamic pattern of Gad1 expression was detected in the developing vibrissae from E12.5 to E14.5 (figure 4A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H).",,,DYNAMIC
"Expression was first detected in the supra-orbital, infra-orbital, and post-oral vibrissae and in the posterior vibrissae in the lateral nasal and maxillary rows (figure 4A,B; nomenclature as in [ 29]).",,,DYNAMIC
Gad1 RNA was also detected in some of the posterior labial vibrissae at this stage.,,,DYNAMIC
Expression was activated in a posterior to anterior,,,DYNAMIC
"(towards the nose) progression in the lateral nasal and maxillary rows,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
reflecting the pattern of vibrissal development [ 29].,,,STATIVE
"By E13.5, Gad1 expression was detected in the anterior lateral nasal and maxillary rows",,,DYNAMIC
"and was activated in the rhinal, labial and submental vibrissae (figure 4C,D).",,,STATIVE
"By E14.5, expression was strong in the labial, submental and rhinal vibrissae (figure 4E,F).",,,STATIVE
Sections of E12.5 whole mounts,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
show,,,STATIVE
that Gad1 expression was localized to the epidermal placodes of the mystacial vibrissae,,,STATIVE
"(figure 4G,H) and was maintained",,,DYNAMIC
as the placodes begin to invaginate (figure 4G).,,,DYNAMIC
Control hybridizations using a sense strand Gad1 probe were also performed.,,,DYNAMIC
Embryos hybridized to the sense probe did not reveal any staining pattern at any of the stages,,,DYNAMIC
tested (E8.5- E14.5).,,,DYNAMIC
Sense strand hybridization results for E10.5 and E11.5 embryos are shown in figure 5.,,,STATIVE
Discussion,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The expression results reported here show,,,STATIVE
that Gad1 was activated in several tissues outside of the central nervous system during mouse development.,,,STATIVE
Transcripts were not seen at E8.5,,,DYNAMIC
and were first detected at E9.0.,,,DYNAMIC
It was surprising,,,STATIVE
that this very early phase of Gad1 expression was largely outside of the developing CNS,,,STATIVE
and was localized in the tail bud mesenchyme and in the pre-apical ectodermal ridge (pre-AER) of the forelimb bud.,,,STATIVE
As development proceeded Gad1 was detected in pharyngeal endoderm and in the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae.,,,DYNAMIC
The data demonstrate,,,STATIVE
that Gad1 is expressed in several sites outside of the developing CNS and in derivatives of all three germ layers.,,,DYNAMIC
We have also detected the expression of Gad1-lacZ transgenes in the developing vibrissae and limbs,,,DYNAMIC
supporting the novel and surprising in situ hybridization results,,,STATIVE
"we report here (J.J. Westmoreland and B.G.C., unpublished results).",,,STATIVE
Previous studies have shown,,,DYNAMIC
that Gad1 can be regulated at the post-transcriptional and translational level.,,,DYNAMIC
"Gad1 mRNA translation or protein stability can be regulated in mature neurons by the level of GABA [ 30, 31].",,,DYNAMIC
"During embryogenesis, post-transcriptional regulation occurs by alternative splicing during embryonic development in rats and mice [ 32, 33].",,,DYNAMIC
"This alternate embryonic transcript inserts a stop codon into the Gad1 mRNA and can produce the truncated proteins, GAD25 and GAD44, from its 5'; and 3' ends respectively.",,,DYNAMIC
The studies reported,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
here used a probe,,,DYNAMIC
that will detect the adult Gad1 mRNA,,,DYNAMIC
that encodes GAD67 as well as the embryonic alternatively spliced mRNA,,,STATIVE
that can encode GAD25 and GAD44.,,,STATIVE
These additional mechanisms of Gad1 regulation may control the production of GAD proteins and the synthesis of GABA in the non-neural cell types,,,DYNAMIC
detected in our study.,,,DYNAMIC
The whole mount in situ hybridization data,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
reported here,,,STATIVE
extends the results of a recently published section in situ hybridization study on E10.5-E12.5 mouse embryos [ 27].,,,DYNAMIC
Our analysis showed,,,DYNAMIC
that Gad1 expression is first detectable earlier at E9.0,,,STATIVE
"and revealed novel non-CNS sites of expression in the pharyngeal region, vibrissae, tail bud and limb bud.",,,DYNAMIC
"The results of the previous study [ 27], together with the data reported herein, provide a comprehensive picture of Gad1 expression in the E9.0-E12.5 mouse embryo.",,,STATIVE
Previous studies have noted Gad expression outside of the CNS.,,,DYNAMIC
"In adults Gad1 and Gad2 have been detected in a number of tissues including kidney, testis, oviduct, pancreatic islets and adrenal cortex [ 34, 35, 36, 37].",,,DYNAMIC
"Previously reported sites of embryonic Gad1 expression outside of the brain and spinal cord during rodent development include the lens fibers and the olfactory pit [ 38, 39].",,,STATIVE
In E10.5-E12.5 mouse embryos Gad1 is expressed in the olfactory,,,DYNAMIC
"and the lens placodes,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
the anlagen of the olfactory pit and lens fibers [ 27].,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
We also detected Gad1 expression in these tissues,,,DYNAMIC
(please see figure 3Aand data not shown).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Expression of Gad in the developing heart and blood vessels has also been reported [ 27].,,,DYNAMIC
We detected weak staining in the heart,,,DYNAMIC
"and did not detect blood vessel expression, perhaps due to the very low levels of expression in developing vasculature [ 27].",,,DYNAMIC
"Our results document localized expression of Gad1 at additional non-CNS sites in the mouse embryo,",,,STATIVE
suggesting a potential role for GABA,,,STATIVE
signaling in the development of these structures.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Our interest in the role of GABA signaling in developing tissues outside of the central nervous system stems from the cleft palate phenotype of the Gad1 and the 3 GABA,,,STATIVE
"A receptor subunit mutants [ 17, 18, 19, 21, 22].",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The genetic data strongly suggest,,,STATIVE
that GABA acts through GABA A receptors to modulate the development of this tissue.,,,DYNAMIC
"Although the data reported here do not explain the origin of the cleft palate phenotype,",,,STATIVE
they do indicate,,,STATIVE
that Gad1 is expressed in several additional non-CNS tissues in the mouse embryo.,,,DYNAMIC
It is particularly noteworthy,,,STATIVE
that these include the AER of the limb buds and the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae.,,,STATIVE
Both are ectodermal structures,,,STATIVE
known to be sources of developmental signals,,,STATIVE
"required for morphogenesis and patterning [ 24, 25, 26, 40].",,,STATIVE
It will be of interest to examine the expression pattern of GABA receptors in the mesenchyme adjacent to these ectodermal signaling centers.,,,STATIVE
Expression of GABA receptor subunits in adjacent tissues would indicate,,,STATIVE
that these receptors read the developmental signals,,,DYNAMIC
mediated by GABA in these structures and tissues.,,,DYNAMIC
Conclusions,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"The mouse gene encoding the 67 kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase ( Gad1 ) is expressed in the tail bud mesenchyme, vibrissal placodes, pharyngeal arches and pouches and the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), mesenchyme and ectoderm of the limb buds in mouse embryos from E9.0-E14.5.",,,DYNAMIC
Some of the Gad1 expressing tissues,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"(vibrissal placodes, AER) are known sources of developmental signals.",,,STATIVE
Other sites of expression correspond to stem cell populations,,,STATIVE
"that give rise to multiple differentiated tissues (tail bud mesenchyme, pharyngeal endoderm and mesenchyme).",,,DYNAMIC
The localized and dynamic expression pattern of Gad1 suggests a wider role for GAD and GABA in the development of non-neural tissues,,,STATIVE
than was previously known.,,,STATIVE
Materials and Methods Whole mount,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
in situ hybridizations were performed on Swiss Webster embryos,,,DYNAMIC
"as described [ 41, 42].",,,STATIVE

The Gad1 probe was derived from an EST clone (accession W59173).,,,DYNAMIC
Its 5' end corresponds to nucleotide 142 in exon 1 [ 43],,,STATIVE
and the 3' end is at nucleotide 2041 in the cDNA sequence [ 44].,,,STATIVE
Digoxygenin sense and antisense RNA probes were generated by labeling with digoxygenin-UTP during transcription.,,,DYNAMIC
Embryos were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight and used immediately for the in situ hybridization.,,,DYNAMIC
The embryos were processed,,,DYNAMIC
as described previously [ 41],,,STATIVE
"and hybridized to the probe overnight in 50% formamide, 5X SSC",,,DYNAMIC
"(pH 5.0), 50 g/ml torula RNA, 50 g/ml heparin at 70C. The final concentration of probe",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
in the hybridization was 1 g/ml.,,,STATIVE
"After an overnight hybridization, the embryos were washed at high stringency in prewarmed 50% formamide,",,,DYNAMIC
"5X SSC, 1% SDS",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
(wash I) at 70C for 90 minutes.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The embryos were then washed in a 1:1 mix of wash I,,,DYNAMIC
and wash II,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"(0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.5,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
0.1% Tween 20) for 10 minutes at 70C.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
