Background,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Primary Sjgren's syndrome (1SS),,,CANNOT_DECIDE
is a systemic autoimmune disorder,,,STATIVE
"characterized by dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), dry mouth (xerostomia) as well as involvement of other exocrine glands.",,,STATIVE
"While 1SS is typically considered an autoimmune exocrinopathy, the immune destruction can often extend to affect non-exocrine organs.",,,STATIVE
"Around 25 % of patients with 1SS can present with involvement of other organs such as the thyroid, central nervous system, lungs, kidney and liver.",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The association of liver disease and 1SS was suggested more than 40 years ago [ 1 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
"While liver involvement in 1SS has been considered ""rare"" [ 2 ]",,,DYNAMIC
only a few clinical studies specifically address this complication,,,STATIVE
and evaluate the association of liver function tests abnormalities with the severity of 1SS [ 3 4 5 6 ] .,,,STATIVE
"Liver diseases associated with 1SS include primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)-autoimmune cholangitis [ 8 9 10 ] , autoimmune hepatitis [ 5 6 ] , viral hepatitis (B and C) [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 ] , sclerosing cholangitis [ 22 ] , and nodular regenerative hyperplasia [ 23 ] .",,,STATIVE
"In addition, chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis has been found in patients with different types of liver cirrhosis",,,DYNAMIC
[ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 ] .,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
We report the results of a review of cases,,,STATIVE
undertaken to determine the prevalence of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and liver disease in patients with 1SS,,,DYNAMIC
referred to a tertiary care center and the association of abnormal LFTs with other systemic features and autoimmunity markers of 1SS.,,,DYNAMIC
Methods,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Statistical analysis The statistical analysis included descriptive measures (means, standard deviations and ranges).",,,STATIVE
Comparison of results of patients with and without liver disease was done using t-tests of continuous variables and Fisher's exact test or x2 for categoric measures.,,,DYNAMIC
"Results Of the 115 charts reviewed, 73 cases (55 women and 18 men, median age 53)",,,STATIVE
fulfilled EECC for 1SS,,,STATIVE
and were initially included for analysis.,,,DYNAMIC
"Of the 73 patients, a 54% of them (40 patients) have had a salivary gland biopsy",,,DYNAMIC
performed.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"In all these patients, the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Sjgren's syndrome.",,,DYNAMIC
All patients studied,,,STATIVE
"had objective evidence of 1SS,",,,STATIVE
"including keratoconjunctivitis sicca, positive labial salivary gland biopsy, autoantibodies and/or salivary gland hypofunction.",,,STATIVE
We excluded those patients,,,DYNAMIC
without these objective criteria of 1SS and also those who did not fulfill EECC criteria.,,,DYNAMIC
The mean age at time of onset of disease was 45  20.5 years old,,,STATIVE
and disease duration was 4.9 years  4.5 years (mean  range).,,,STATIVE
Liver function tests had been determined in 59 patients (80.8 %),,,DYNAMIC
and abnormal liver function tests were found in 29,,,DYNAMIC
of the 59 patients (49.1 %).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Further analysis was then undertaken in those patients in whom LFTs had been measured.,,,DYNAMIC
The clinical and laboratory characteristics of these patients are shown in Tables 2and 3.,,,STATIVE
"For these SS patients studied, abnormal LFTs were more common than any other potential non-exocrine features of SS.",,,STATIVE
"Clinical evidence of liver disease, defined in methods section, was found in 12 patients (20.3%),",,,DYNAMIC
all of whom had abnormal liver function tests.,,,STATIVE
Two deaths occurred in the population,,,DYNAMIC
"studied,",,,STATIVE
both attributed to liver failure.,,,STATIVE
An additional patient required a liver transplant.,,,STATIVE
"In all cases, the diagnosis of 1SS antedated the onset of liver disease or its diagnosis.",,,STATIVE
"Markers of viral hepatitis, sought in 39 patients, were found only in 4.",,,DYNAMIC
Two patients carried the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus,,,STATIVE
and one had antibodies to hepatitis C virus.,,,STATIVE
"In a liver biopsy of a patient who lacked serological markers for hepatitis viruses, hepatitis B virus was detected by in situ hybridization.",,,DYNAMIC
Risk factors for liver disease were identified in 40% of the patients with abnormal liver function tests,,,DYNAMIC
and are described in Table 4.,,,STATIVE
No association with tobacco use was found.,,,DYNAMIC
Only 5 patients had documented evidence of tobacco consumption.,,,STATIVE
We found no significant differences in risk factors for abnormal liver function tests among patients with or without hepatic involvement.,,,DYNAMIC
"Therefore, in 60% of the patients with sub clinical or clinical evidence of liver disease, no clear explanation for the abnormal LFTs was found, except for the association with 1SS.",,,DYNAMIC
The pattern of biochemical liver abnormalities was mainly hepatocellular,,,STATIVE
(defined as predominant increase of AST and/or ALT in comparison with AP and/or bilirubins) in 11 cases; cholestatic,,,STATIVE
(defined as predominant increase in AP and/or bilirubins compared with AST and/or ALT) in 3,,,STATIVE
and mixed (evidence of both cholestatic and hepatocellular damage) in 8 cases.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Abnormalities were persistent,,,STATIVE
(present on every occasion when measured more than once),,,DYNAMIC
"in 19 patients (65.5% of those with abnormal LFTs), intermittent (presence of LFT abnormalities was not found in all determinations) in 9",,,DYNAMIC
(31%) and in one case (3.5%),,,CANNOT_DECIDE
there was only one determination of liver function tests.,,,STATIVE
The pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities is shown in Figure 1.,,,STATIVE
None of the patients with abnormal liver function tests had clinical evidence of muscle involvement,,,STATIVE
that could explain the high levels of amino-transferases.,,,STATIVE
Activity of CPK or aldolase was not elevated,,,STATIVE
when measured in 15 of the 29 patients with abnormal liver function tests.,,,DYNAMIC
Anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA),,,CANNOT_DECIDE
and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA),,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"were sought in 5 patients, with positive ASMA in 2.",,,DYNAMIC
The association of abnormal liver function tests with other non-exocrine features of 1SS is shown in Figure 2.,,,STATIVE
"Patients with abnormal liver function tests were more likely to have lung, kidney or hematological manifestations,",,,STATIVE
when compared to Sjgren's patients without liver disease.,,,DYNAMIC
Presence of other non-exocrine features of 1SS was not influenced by prevalence of liver diseases.,,,DYNAMIC
"Regarding laboratory test results, patients with liver disease were more likely to have an elevated sedimentation rate at some point during the course of their disease.",,,STATIVE
"A positive anti-ENA (anti-Ro, anti-Ro/La, and/or anti-RNP)",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
was also associated with an increased prevalence of abnormal liver function tests (Figure 3).,,,STATIVE
The sample was too small to determine,,,STATIVE
whether a specific ENA was associated with liver disease.,,,STATIVE
Other markers of systemic inflammation or autoimmunity did not correlate with the presence or absence of LFT abnormalities.,,,STATIVE
"Liver biopsies, done in 8 patients,",,,DYNAMIC
"disclosed post-viral chronic active hepatitis (3), cryptogenic cirrhosis (2), and one case each of post-viral cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and autoimmune hepatitis.",,,DYNAMIC
Discussion,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"In this group of Sjgren's patients seen at a tertiary care center, abnormal liver function tests were found to be a common non-exocrine feature of 1SS.",,,DYNAMIC
The prevalence of this association was found to be higher in our study than in other previous series [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
The true prevalence could be even higher,,,STATIVE
since liver enzyme profiles were not done in all patients.,,,DYNAMIC
"The prevalence suggested in previous reports ranges from 6 to 58 %,",,,STATIVE
but the definition of hepatic disease varies from the unspecific (e.g. hepatomegaly) to well proven cases of liver disease [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 28 ] .,,,STATIVE
Denko in 1960 reported,,,DYNAMIC
that 12% of patients with SS had hepatosplenomegaly [ 29 ] .,,,STATIVE
Other studies done in the 1960's also confirmed hepatomegaly in 18-20% of patients with SS [ 30 31 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
"In 1970, Whaley reported liver disease in 6% of patients with SS",,,DYNAMIC
and mentioned an association with anti-mitochondrial antibodies [ 2 ] .,,,DYNAMIC
"In 1986, Tsianos and co-workers described 22 SS patients with gastrointestinal complications, called from a large cohort;",,,DYNAMIC
"only two patients had liver disease, each with chronic active hepatitis [ 4 ] .",,,STATIVE
Other studies have reported variable prevalence [ 3 28 ] and different histopathological findings in liver biopsies,,,DYNAMIC
ranging from cholestatic liver damage,,,STATIVE
(stage I primary biliary cirrhosis) to chronic active hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"In our study, liver disease was associated with other non-exocrine manifestations of 1SS, specifically those",,,STATIVE
"affecting lung, kidney and blood cells.",,,STATIVE
"Those patients with serological evidence of systemic inflammation, as shown by an elevated sedimentation rate,",,,DYNAMIC
were more likely to have liver test abnormalities.,,,STATIVE
"Also, the presence of a positive anti-ENA correlated positively with hepatic disease.",,,STATIVE
"An association of ENA response with liver disease has been described in children with autoimmune hepatitis,",,,DYNAMIC
where anti-ENA-positive patients demonstrated more severe liver test abnormalities than those,,,DYNAMIC
who were anti-ENA-negative [ 32 ] .,,,STATIVE
"In another study, a 15 % of patients with various chronic liver diseases were found to be anti-RNP positive [ 33 ] .",,,DYNAMIC
"With etiopathogenesis of 1SS still an open question [ 34 ] , a possible role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has drawn attention.",,,DYNAMIC
Recent studies have mentioned HCV incidence in patients with 1SS,,,DYNAMIC
ranging from 14-19% [ 11 12 16 18 21 ] .,,,STATIVE
Phenotypic characterization of the minor salivary glands with immunohistochemistry in patients with hepatitis,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
C virus infection and/or 1SS has given conflicting results,,,DYNAMIC
[ 14 15 ],,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Some reports mention,,,DYNAMIC
that the salivary gland findings are strikingly similar in patients with liver disease,,,STATIVE
"associated with HCV infection than in those with 1SS [ 12 ] ,",,,STATIVE
while others mention distinctive differences between both groups,,,DYNAMIC
"regarding focus score,",,,STATIVE
"expression of surface markers in lymphocytes infiltrating the salivary glands and in epithelial cells, as well as differences in the degree of inflammation [ 14 15 ] .",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Transgenic mice models that carry the HCV envelope genes develop an exocrinopathy,,,DYNAMIC
affecting salivary and lachrymal glands [ 19 ] .,,,STATIVE
Expression of autoimmunity markers also tends to differ between HCV-infection and 1SS.,,,STATIVE
Positive ENAs are rarely seen in HCV-patients.,,,DYNAMIC
"Also, in most cases sicca symptoms are not present in individuals with HCV as compared with the 1SS population.",,,STATIVE
Although the prevalence of viral hepatitis markers in our group of patients with liver disease was very low,,,STATIVE
"and did not account for most of the cases with abnormal liver function tests, these markers were not sought in a small percentage of these patients.",,,DYNAMIC
It is important to note,,,STATIVE
that HCV appears to account for a subgroup of patients with exocrine complaints,,,STATIVE
in which half the cases might meet the definition for SS according to European and Manthorpe criteria.,,,STATIVE
"However, this subgroup is characterized by the absence of clinical manifestations",,,STATIVE
"observed in 1SS, and the absence of anti-Ro and anti-La [ 35 ] .",,,STATIVE
An aberrant interaction between lymphocytes and different epithelial tissues has been proposed as a mechanism for the damage,,,DYNAMIC
seen in different organs in 1 SS [ 36 ] .,,,STATIVE
Since it has been suggested that the target tissue,,,DYNAMIC
"involved in the autoimmune histopathologic lesions of 1SS might be the epithelium [ 37 ] ,",,,STATIVE
it is interesting,,,STATIVE
"that the findings in our study point to the association of liver disease with pulmonary and renal abnormalities, all which are characterized by epithelial damage [ 38 39 ] .",,,STATIVE
Epithelial cells have been proposed to be active participants rather than passive targets in the chronic immune response in 1SS,,,DYNAMIC
"but further studies are needed to establish the role of liver epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of hepatic damage in this disease,",,,STATIVE
including the analysis of HLA expression and cytokine secretion pattern in these cells.,,,STATIVE
The co-existence of liver disease and the presence of circulating AMAs in Sjgren's patients sera has been pointed as an indicator,,,DYNAMIC
that liver pathology might be autoimmune and similar to that of primary biliary cirrhosis [ 4 7 8 10 ] .,,,STATIVE
"In previous studies, a pericholangial lymphocytic infiltration similar to that found in stage I of primary biliary cirrhosis, has been reported in 1SS with abnormal liver function tests or positivity for AMA [ 4 7 ] .",,,DYNAMIC
"In our review of cases, we found predominance in hepatocellular liver damage rather than cholestatic disease,",,,DYNAMIC
which would argue against a PBC-type of liver damage.,,,DYNAMIC
Other authors had proposed,,,DYNAMIC
that SS associated with PBC should be considered a form,,,STATIVE
"of secondary SS that resembles more the ""sicca complex"" with exocrine features",,,STATIVE
seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [ 40 41 ] .,,,STATIVE
Limitations of the study come primarily from being a retrospective analysis.,,,STATIVE
"Since the patients were studied in a tertiary care referral center, the severity of the disease and the prevalence of the manifestations might be different from the general 1SS population.",,,DYNAMIC
"Furthermore, in many cases, Sjgren's syndrome diagnosis had been sought because of otherwise unexplained non-exocrine features.",,,DYNAMIC
"While we could not find an association between use of NSAIDS or other medications and prevalence of liver function tests abnormalities, the study design did not allow us to exclude the possibility of over-the-counter",,,DYNAMIC
(OTC) medication use that could have affected LFT's measurement.,,,DYNAMIC
Drug toxicity is certainly an important factor to be considered.,,,STATIVE
"However, given that most patients had persistent rather than intermittent abnormalities of LFTs",,,STATIVE
"and that the use of hepatotoxic drugs was not elicited in the majority of patients with liver abnormalities, a toxic effect of medications could not be established.",,,DYNAMIC
Conclusions,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Based on the results of this study,",,,STATIVE
we consider,,,STATIVE
"that an evaluation for clinical and serological evidence of liver disease should be done in every patient with 1SS,",,,DYNAMIC
particularly if there is evidence of other non-exocrine complications or serological evidence of systemic inflammation.,,,STATIVE
"Although no other diagnosis explaining liver disease may be found, the disorders",,,DYNAMIC
for which treatment might be beneficial,,,STATIVE
"(e.g. immunosuppressants for autoimmune hepatitis, interferon-alpha for viral hepatitis, ursodeoxycolic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis) warrant a diligent search in all cases of 1SS with abnormal liver function.",,,STATIVE
