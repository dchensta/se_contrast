"Archimedes' screw, also called the Archimedean screw or screwpump,",called,screw,STATIVE
is a machine,is,screw,STATIVE
historically used for transferring water from a low-lying body of water into irrigation ditches.,used,machine,DYNAMIC
Water is pumped by turning a screw-shaped surface inside a hollow pipe.,pumped,Water,DYNAMIC
The screw pump is commonly attributed to Archimedes on the occasion of his visit to Egypt.,attributed,pump,DYNAMIC
This tradition may reflect,reflect,tradition,DYNAMIC

== Design ==,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Archimedes' screw consists of a screw,,,STATIVE
(a helical surface surrounding a central cylindrical shaft) inside a hollow pipe.,surrounding,surface,STATIVE
The screw is turned usually by a windmill or by manual labour.,turned,screw,DYNAMIC
"As the shaft turns, the bottom end scoops up a volume of water.",scoops,end,DYNAMIC
"This water will slide up in the spiral tube,",slide,water,DYNAMIC
until it finally pours out from the top of the tube,pours,it,DYNAMIC
and feeds the irrigation systems.,feeds,it,DYNAMIC
The screw was used,used,screw,DYNAMIC
mostly for draining water out of mines or other areas of low lying water.,draining,screw,CANNOT_DECIDE
"The contact surface between the screw and the pipe does not need to be perfectly watertight, as long as the amount of water",need,surface,STATIVE
being scooped with each turn is large,is,amount,STATIVE
compared to the amount of water,compared,,STATIVE
leaking out of each section of the screw per turn.,leaking,,DYNAMIC
"Water from one section leaks into the next lower one,",leaks,Water,DYNAMIC
so that a sort of mechanical equilibrium is achieved in use.,achieved,sort,DYNAMIC
"In some designs, the screw is attached to the casing and they both rotate together, instead of the screw turning within a stationary casing.",attached,screw,STATIVE
"A screw could be sealed with pitch resin or some other adhesive to its casing,",sealed,screw,STATIVE
or cast as a single piece in bronze.,cast,screw,DYNAMIC
Some researchers have postulated this as being the device,postulated,researchers,DYNAMIC
"used to irrigate the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.",used,device,DYNAMIC
"Depictions of Greek and Roman water screws show them being powered by a human treading on the outer casing to turn the entire apparatus as one piece,",show,Depictions,DYNAMIC
which would require,require,piece,STATIVE
that the casing be rigidly attached to the screw.,attached,casing,STATIVE

"Along with transferring water to irrigation ditches, the device was also used for draining land",used,device,DYNAMIC
that was underneath the sea in the Netherlands and other places in the creation of polders.,was,land,STATIVE
A part of the sea would be enclosed,enclosed,part,DYNAMIC
"and the water would be pumped out of the enclosed area, starting the process of draining the land for use in agriculture.",pumped,part,DYNAMIC
"Depending on the length and diameter of the screws, more than one machine could be used successively to lift the same water.",Depending,,DYNAMIC
An Archimedes' screw was used by British soils engineer John Burland in the successful 2001 stabilization of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.,used,screw,DYNAMIC
"Small amounts of subsoil saturated by groundwater were removed from far below the north side of the Tower,",removed,amounts,DYNAMIC
and the weight of the tower itself corrected the lean.,corrected,amounts,DYNAMIC
Archimedes' screws are used in sewage treatment plants,used,screws,DYNAMIC
because they cope well with varying rates of flow and with suspended solids.,cope,they,DYNAMIC
An auger in a snow blower or grain elevator is essentially an Archimedes' screw.,is,auger,STATIVE
Many forms of axial flow pump basically contain an Archimedes' screw.,contain,forms,STATIVE
"The principle is also found in pescalators,",found,principle,DYNAMIC
which are Archimedes' screws,are,pescalators,STATIVE
designed to lift fish safely from ponds,designed,screws,STATIVE
and transport them to another location.,transport,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"This technology is used primarily at fish hatcheries,",used,technology,DYNAMIC
where it is desirable to minimize the physical handling of fish.,is,it,STATIVE

==History==,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The invention of the water screw is credited to the Greek polymath Archimedes of Syracuse in the 3rd century BC.,credited,=,STATIVE
A cuneiform inscription of the Assyrian king Sennacherib (704 - 681BC) has been interpreted by Dalley to describe the casting of water screws in bronze some 350 years earlier.,interpreted,inscription,DYNAMIC
This is consistent with the classical author Strabo,is,This,STATIVE
who describes the Hanging Gardens,describes,Strabo,DYNAMIC
as watered by screws.,watered,Strabo,DYNAMIC
A contrary view is expressed by Dalley and Oleson in an earlier review.,expressed,view,DYNAMIC
"The German engineer Konrad Kyeser, in his Bellifortis (1405), equips the Archimedes' screw with a crank mechanism.",equips,Kyeser,DYNAMIC
This mechanism soon replaced the ancient practice,replaced,mechanism,DYNAMIC

A screw conveyor is an Archimedes' screw,is,contained,STATIVE
contained within a tube,contained,screw,STATIVE
and turned by a motor so as to deliver material from one end of the conveyor to the other.,turned,screw,DYNAMIC
It is particularly suitable for transport of granular materials such as plastic granules,is,It,STATIVE
"used in injection molding, and cereal grains.",used,granules,DYNAMIC
It may also be used to transport liquids.,used,It,DYNAMIC
In industrial control applications the conveyor may be used as a rotary feeder or variable rate feeder to deliver a measured rate or quantity of material into a process.,used,conveyor,DYNAMIC
"A variant of the Archimedes' screw can also be found in some injection molding machines, die casting machines and extrusion of plastics,",found,variant,STATIVE
which employ a screw of decreasing pitch to compress and melt the material.,employ,plastics,DYNAMIC
"Finally, it is also used in a specific type of positive displacement air compressor: the rotary-screw air compressor.",used,it,DYNAMIC
"On a much larger scale, Archimedes' screws of decreasing pitch are used for the compaction of waste material.",used,screws,DYNAMIC
===Reverse action===,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"If water is poured into the top of an Archimedes' screw,",poured,water,DYNAMIC
it will force the screw to rotate.,force,it,DYNAMIC
The rotating shaft can then be used to drive an electric generator.,used,shaft,DYNAMIC
Such an installation has the same benefits as using the screw for pumping,has,installation,STATIVE
