Introduction,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
As recognized by the President's National Energy Plan,recognized,one,STATIVE
"(NEP), one of the principal energy challenges facing us is increasing our energy supplies in ways",increasing,one,STATIVE
that protect and improve the environment.,protect,ways,STATIVE
"Thus, the President directed EPA to propose legislation",directed,President,DYNAMIC
"that would significantly reduce SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions from power generation through a cap and trade program.",reduce,legislation,DYNAMIC
"Such a program, coupled with appropriate measures to address local concerns,",coupled,program,STATIVE
would provide significant health benefits,provide,program,DYNAMIC
even as we increase energy supplies,increase,we,DYNAMIC
and maintain reasonable electricity rates.,maintain,program,DYNAMIC
Our work on this issue has given us insight,given,work,DYNAMIC
that I believe,believe,I,STATIVE
will be helpful to you.,be,that,STATIVE
The more I learn about the cost and inefficiencies of the current and future regulatory regime to which power generators will be subjected,learn,I,DYNAMIC
"if we do not have new legislation, the more I am convinced that we can",convinced,I,STATIVE
-- and must -- develop a smarter approach,develop,we,DYNAMIC
that protects the environment and public health,protects,approach,STATIVE
while reducing the cost to consumers and industry,reducing,,DYNAMIC
and optimizing the size of both the state and federal government machinery necessary to achieve that protection.,optimizing,,DYNAMIC
"It is possible to achieve better results at lower costs, but not if we simply add yet another program on top of all of the existing regulations.",is,It,STATIVE
"The current Clean Air Act has been enormously successful,",been,Act,STATIVE
but we can do better.,do,Act,DYNAMIC
Significant cost savings can be achieved for power generators and consumers through a comprehensive legislative package.,achieved,savings,DYNAMIC
I look forward to working with you to develop such an approach to reduce emissions from power generation.,look,I,STATIVE
We applaud Senator Jeffords for tackling this important issue and for recognizing,applaud,We,DYNAMIC
that a cap and trade program is the best way to achieve these reductions.,is,program,STATIVE
"However, we have significant concerns with S. 556 as drafted.",have,we,STATIVE
Our analysis to date suggests,suggests,analysis,STATIVE
"that it could increase consumers' electricity rates by as much as 50%,",increase,it,DYNAMIC
which we believe,believe,we,STATIVE
is unacceptable.,is,%,STATIVE
"In addition, the combination of emission reductions and timing is not feasible",is,combination,STATIVE
and could threaten the reliability of electricity supply.,threaten,combination,DYNAMIC
We are concerned,are,We,STATIVE
"that S. 556's short timeframes for installation of controls could lead power plants to be taken off-line at important times,",lead,timeframes,DYNAMIC
which could lead to electricity shortages.,lead,times,DYNAMIC
"In addition, there are a number of issues",are,number,STATIVE
that Congress should consider,consider,Congress,DYNAMIC
that S. 556 does not address.,address,556,STATIVE
"As drafted, S. 556 would make some existing requirements unnecessary,",make,556,DYNAMIC
but would not eliminate them.,eliminate,556,DYNAMIC
"Rather than add yet another layer of environmental regulations on top of the existing ones,",add,,DYNAMIC
we believe,believe,we,STATIVE
that S. 556 should eliminate those unnecessary existing requirements.,eliminate,556,DYNAMIC
S. 556 also does not have an allocation scheme.,have,556,STATIVE
"One lesson we should learn from the success of the Acid Rain cap and trade program is that when certain key issues can be resolved through clear legislation,",is,lesson,STATIVE
"we can avoid years of litigation, business uncertainty and costs, and delayed environmental protection.",avoid,we,DYNAMIC
"Finally, and most importantly, the Administration strongly opposes including CO2 reductions in any multi-pollutant bill.",opposes,Administration,STATIVE
The CO2 provisions in S. 556 will cost consumers too much,cost,provisions,DYNAMIC
and endanger our energy security by causing too much electricity generation to switch from coal to natural gas.,endanger,provisions,DYNAMIC
"Greenhouse gas emissions should be addressed in the context of climate change,",addressed,emissions,DYNAMIC
which is being undertaken by the President's Cabinet level working group.,undertaken,context,DYNAMIC
"For all of these reasons, the Administration must oppose S. 556.",oppose,Administration,STATIVE
In my testimony today I will elaborate further on these key points.,elaborate,I,DYNAMIC
Background,Background,we,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Over the last 30 years, we have made substantial progress towards improved environmental quality under the Clean Air Act.",made,we,DYNAMIC
"During this time, gross domestic product has increased almost 160%.",increased,product,DYNAMIC
"At the same time, we have reduced emissions of six key air pollutants by 29%,",reduced,we,DYNAMIC
while coal consumption has increased 77%,increased,consumption,DYNAMIC
and energy consumption has increased 45%.,increased,consumption,DYNAMIC
Eleven years ago President George H. W. Bush signed into law the most far reaching amendments to the Clean Air Act since its enactment in 1970.,signed,Bush,DYNAMIC
"Included in those amendments was the Acid Rain cap and trade program, the first program",Included,program,STATIVE
"tailored specifically to the utility sector,",tailored,program,STATIVE
which is achieving significant environmental and public health benefits at a fraction of the initial cost estimates and with relatively little government bureaucracy.,achieving,cap,DYNAMIC
It is time to revisit and update the Clean Air Act once again,is,It,STATIVE
in order to achieve the additional reductions,achieve,again,CANNOT_DECIDE
needed to address public health and environmental problems in the most cost effective manner.,needed,reductions,STATIVE
The Acid Rain Program is achieving its emission reduction goal at a fraction of the estimated costs,achieving,Program,DYNAMIC
because it allows and encourages innovative thinking and long range planning.1,allows,it,STATIVE
The existing program establishes a cap on SO2 emissions to ensure,establishes,program,STATIVE
"that the environmental goal is met,",met,goal,DYNAMIC
and employs an innovative market-based allowance trading program to achieve the goal at lowest cost.,employs,it,STATIVE
Allowances are the currency,are,Allowances,STATIVE
with which compliance with the SO2 emissions requirements is achieved.,achieved,compliance,DYNAMIC
"Sources, rather than government, decide the most cost-effective way to use available resources to comply.",decide,government,DYNAMIC
Units that reduce their emissions below the number of allowances,reduce,Units,DYNAMIC
they hold,hold,they,STATIVE
"may trade allowances with other units in the system,",trade,Units,DYNAMIC
sell them to other sources,sell,Units,DYNAMIC
or save them for future use.,save,Units,STATIVE
There are neither restrictions on trading nor government second-guessing.,are,restrictions,STATIVE
Allowance trading provides incentives for energy conservation and technology innovation,provides,trading,STATIVE
that can both lower the cost of compliance and yield pollution prevention benefits.,lower,innovation,DYNAMIC
"Simply, the allowance market puts a price or value on each ton of SO2",puts,market,DYNAMIC
not emitted.,emitted,ton,DYNAMIC
The association of a monetary value with reduced emissions encourages innovation:,encourages,association,STATIVE
"in the 1990's, scrubber costs decreased by approximately 40% and scrubber sulfur removal efficiencies improved from 90% to 95%, and experimentation",improved,costs,DYNAMIC
led to the blending of fuels to lower emissions.,led,experimentation,DYNAMIC
To ensure,ensure,,CANNOT_DECIDE
that the cap is met,met,cap,DYNAMIC
"and to provide credibility,",provide,,CANNOT_DECIDE
sources also are required to install systems,required,sources,STATIVE
that continuously monitor and report emissions.,monitor,systems,DYNAMIC
The Acid Rain Program has proven to be an excellent model for cap and trade programs.,proven,Program,DYNAMIC
Compliance with the program has been nearly 100 percent,been,Compliance,STATIVE
and annual emissions of SO2 from power plants have already been reduced over 6 million tons,reduced,percent,DYNAMIC
(about 35 percent) from 1980 levels.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Greater reductions earlier than expected have lowered risks to human health and provided benefits to the environment sooner.,lowered,reductions,DYNAMIC
Acid rain levels were dramatically reduced over large areas of the U.S.,reduced,levels,DYNAMIC
"and trading did not result in geographic shifting of emissions, or ""hot spots"",",result,levels,DYNAMIC
as some feared.,feared,reduced,STATIVE

Business as Usual,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"The President's flexible, market-based approach to reducing emissions from power generators stands in sharp contrast to the complex web of existing regulations",stands,Business,STATIVE
which currently confront the industry.,confront,regulations,STATIVE
"Over the years, Congress, EPA and the States have responded to specific environmental and public health problems by developing separate regulatory programs to address the specific problems.",responded,EPA,DYNAMIC
Each individual program uses its own approach on its own timeline to serve its own purpose.,uses,program,DYNAMIC
"Absent changes to the Act, EPA and states will be forced to follow the same approach in future regulations.",forced,states,DYNAMIC
It is time to consolidate and simplify to achieve our clean air goals.,is,It,STATIVE
A comprehensive legislative approach with mandatory caps could replace a good portion of the current regulatory requirements with a system,replace,approach,DYNAMIC

it will be a win-win.,be,it,STATIVE
There are many regulations in place,are,regulations,STATIVE
that will reduce air emissions from electric power generation.,reduce,regulations,DYNAMIC
These regulations include both federal and State requirements,include,regulations,STATIVE
that address a variety of emissions,address,requirements,STATIVE

"These programs include the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for SO2, particulate matter and ozone, the section 126 and the NOx SIP Call rules, the Acid Rain Program, new source review, new source performance standards, and the regional haze rule.",include,programs,STATIVE
But the regulation of power generators does not end with existing regulations.,end,regulation,STATIVE
EPA is obligated by a settlement agreement to issue by the end of 2004 a Maximum Achievable Control Technology,obligated,EPA,STATIVE
(MACT) standard to require source-specific controls of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from electric utilities.,require,standard,CANNOT_DECIDE
