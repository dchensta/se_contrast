"In 1942, while searching for materials to make clear plastic gun sights,",searching,,DYNAMIC
"Coover and his team at Eastman Kodak examined cyanoacrylates, a material",examined,searching,DYNAMIC
"that was used during both World Wars as an alternative to stitches on large cuts and wounds,",used,material,DYNAMIC
rejecting them as too sticky.,rejecting,,DYNAMIC
"Nine years later, Coover was overseeing Kodak chemists",overseeing,Coover,DYNAMIC
investigating heat-resistant polymers for jet canopies,investigating,Coover,DYNAMIC
when cyanoacrylates were once again tested,tested,cyanoacrylates,DYNAMIC
and proved too sticky.,proved,cyanoacrylates,DYNAMIC
"That time around, however, Coover recognized",recognized,time,DYNAMIC
that he had discovered a unique adhesive.,discovered,he,DYNAMIC
"In 1958, the adhesive, marketed by Kodak as Super Glue,",marketed,adhesive,DYNAMIC
was introduced for sale.,introduced,adhesive,DYNAMIC
"Generally, cyanoacrylate is an acrylic resin",is,resin,STATIVE
which rapidly polymerises in the presence of water,polymerises,resin,DYNAMIC
"(specifically hydroxide ions), forming long, strong chains,",forming,resin,DYNAMIC
joining the bonded surfaces together.,joining,forming,DYNAMIC
"Because the presence of moisture causes the glue to set, exposure to moisture in the air can cause a tube or bottle of glue to become unusable over time.",cause,exposure,DYNAMIC
"To prevent an opened container of glue from setting before use,",prevent,,CANNOT_DECIDE
it must be stored in an airtight jar or bottle with a package of silica gel.,stored,it,STATIVE
Another convenient way is attaching a hypodermic needle on the opening of glue.,attaching,way,STATIVE
"After applying, residual glue soon clogs the needle,",clogs,glue,DYNAMIC
keeping moisture out.,keeping,glue,DYNAMIC
The clog is removed by heating the needle,removed,clog,DYNAMIC

"Cyanoacrylate is used as a forensic tool to capture latent fingerprints on non-porous surfaces like glass, plastic, etc.",used,Cyanoacrylate,DYNAMIC
Cyanoacrylate is warmed to produce fumes,warmed,Cyanoacrylate,DYNAMIC
which react with the invisible fingerprint residues and atmospheric moisture to form a white polymer,react,fumes,DYNAMIC
(polycyanoacrylate) on the fingerprint ridges.,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The ridges can then be recorded.,recorded,ridges,DYNAMIC
"The developed fingerprints are, on most surfaces",are,except,STATIVE
"(except on white plastic or similar), visible to the naked eye.",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Invisible or poorly visible prints can be further enhanced by applying a luminescent or non-luminescent stain.,enhanced,prints,DYNAMIC
"While much attention was given to the glue's capacity to bond solid materials, Coover was also the first to recognize and patent cyanoacrylates as a tissue adhesive.",was,Coover,STATIVE
"First used in the Vietnam War to temporarily patch the internal organs of injured soldiers until conventional surgery could be performed,",used,adhesives,DYNAMIC
tissue adhesives are now used worldwide for a variety of sutureless surgical applications.,used,adhesives,DYNAMIC
