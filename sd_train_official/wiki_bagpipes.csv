"Bagpipes are a class of musical instrument, aerophones,",are,Bagpipes,STATIVE
using enclosed reeds fed from a constant reservoir of air in the form of a bag.,using,bagpipes,DYNAMIC
"Though the Scottish Great Highland bagpipe have the greatest visibility in the English-speaking world, bagpipes have been played for centuries",played,bagpipes,DYNAMIC
"(and continue to be played) throughout large parts of Europe, Turkey, the Caucasus, around the Persian Gulf and in Northern Africa.",continue,played,STATIVE
"The term ""bagpipe"" is equally correct in the singular or plural,",is,bagpipe,STATIVE
"although in the English language, pipers most commonly talk of ""the pipes"", ""a set of pipes"" or ""a stand of pipes"".",talk,pipers,DYNAMIC
== Construction ==,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"A set of bagpipes minimally consists of an air supply, a bag, a chanter, and, usually, at least one drone.",consists,=,STATIVE
Most bagpipes have more than one drone,have,,STATIVE
"(and, sometimes, more than one chanter) in various combinations, held in place in stocks",held,bagpipes,STATIVE
 sockets,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
that fasten the various pipes to the bag.,fasten,sockets,STATIVE
=== Air supply ===,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"The most common method of supplying air to the bag is through blowing into a blowpipe, or blowstick.",is,=,STATIVE
"In some pipes the player must cover the tip of the blowpipe with his tongue while inhaling,",cover,player,DYNAMIC
but most blowpipes have a non-return valve,have,player,STATIVE
that eliminates this need.,eliminates,valve,DYNAMIC
"An innovation, dating from the 16th or 17th century,",dating,innovation,STATIVE
is the use of a bellows to supply air.,is,innovation,STATIVE
"In these pipes, sometimes called ""cauld wind pipes"", air is not heated or moistened by the player's breathing,",heated,air,DYNAMIC
so bellows-driven bagpipes can use more refined or delicate reeds.,use,bagpipes,DYNAMIC
"Such pipes include the Irish uilleann pipes, the Scottish border pipes and Lowland pipes; Northumbrian smallpipes, pastoral pipes and English Border pipes in Britain, and the musette de cour in France.",include,pipes,STATIVE
=== Bag ===,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
The bag is an airtight reservoir,is,Bag,STATIVE
that can hold air,hold,used,STATIVE
"and can be used to regulate its flow,",used,reservoir,DYNAMIC
enabling the player to maintain continuous sound.,enabling,,DYNAMIC
The player keeps the bag,keeps,player,DYNAMIC
inflated by blowing air into it through a blowpipe,inflated,bag,DYNAMIC
or pumping air into it with a bellows.,pumping,,DYNAMIC
"Materials used for bags vary widely,",vary,Materials,STATIVE
"but the most common are the skins of local animals such as goats, dogs, sheep, and cows.",are,common,STATIVE
"More recently, bags made of synthetic materials",made,bags,STATIVE
including Gore-Tex have become much more common.,including,,DYNAMIC
"However, a drawback of the synthetic bag is the potential",is,drawback,STATIVE
"for fungal spores to colonise the bag because of a reduction in necessary cleaning, with the associated danger of lung infection.",colonise,potential,CANNOT_DECIDE
Bags cut from larger materials are usually saddle-stitched with an extra strip,saddle-stitched,Bags,DYNAMIC
folded over the seam,folded,strip,DYNAMIC
and stitched (for skin bags),stitched,strip,DYNAMIC
or glued (for synthetic bags) to reduce leaks.,glued,,DYNAMIC
Holes are then cut to accommodate the stocks.,cut,Holes,DYNAMIC
In the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins the stocks are typically tied into the points,tied,stocks,DYNAMIC
"where limbs and the head joined the body of the living animal, a construction technique common in Central Europe.",joined,head,STATIVE
=== Chanter ===,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"The chanter is the melody pipe, played with two hands.",is,=,STATIVE
Almost all bagpipes have at least one chanter;,have,bagpipes,STATIVE
"some pipes have two chanters, particularly those in North Africa, the Balkans in Southern Europe, and Southwest Asia.",have,pipes,STATIVE
A chanter can be bored internally,bored,chanter,STATIVE
so that the inside walls are parallel,are,walls,STATIVE
"(or ""cylindrical"") for its full length, or it can be bored in a conical shape.",bored,chanter,STATIVE
"The chanter is usually open-ended,",is,chanter,STATIVE
so there is no easy way,is,way,STATIVE
for the player to stop the pipe from sounding.,stop,way,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Thus most bagpipes share a constant, legato sound",share,bagpipes,STATIVE
where there are no rests in the music.,are,rests,STATIVE
"Primarily because of this inability to stop playing, technical movements are used to break up notes",used,movements,DYNAMIC
and to create the illusion of articulation and accents.,create,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Because of their importance, these embellishments (or ""ornaments"") are often highly technical systems specific to each bagpipe,",are,embellishments,STATIVE
and take many years of study to master.,take,systems,DYNAMIC
"A few bagpipes (such as the musette de cour, the uilleann pipes, the Northumbrian smallpipe, and the left chanter of the surdulina, a type of Calabrian zampogna) have closed ends or stop the end on the player's leg,",closed,bagpipes,STATIVE
"so that when the player ""closes""",closes,player,DYNAMIC
(covers all the holes),covers,,DYNAMIC
the chanter becomes silent.,becomes,chanter,DYNAMIC
==== Chanter reed ====,reed,Chanter,CANNOT_DECIDE
The note from the chanter is produced by a reed,produced,Chanter,DYNAMIC
installed at its top.,installed,reed,STATIVE
The reed may be a single,be,reed,STATIVE
(a reed with one vibrating tongue) or double reed (of two pieces,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
that vibrate against each other).,vibrate,pieces,DYNAMIC
Double reeds are used with both conical- and parallel-bored chanters,used,reeds,DYNAMIC
while single reeds are generally,are,,STATIVE
(although not exclusively) limited to parallel-bored chanters.,limited,reeds,CANNOT_DECIDE
"In general, double-reed chanters are found in pipes of Western Europe",found,chanters,STATIVE

=== Drone ===,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Most bagpipes have at least one drone:,have,bagpipes,STATIVE
a pipe which is generally not fingered,fingered,pipe,STATIVE
but rather produces a constant harmonizing note throughout play.,produces,,DYNAMIC
These drones have reeds just like in the chanter.,have,drones,STATIVE
Exceptions are generally those pipes,are,Exceptions,STATIVE
which have a double-chanter instead.,have,pipes,STATIVE
"A drone is most commonly a cylindrically-bored tube with a single reed,",is,drone,STATIVE
although drones with double reeds exist.,exist,drones,STATIVE
The drone is generally designed in two or more parts with a sliding joint,designed,drone,STATIVE
so that the pitch of the drone can be adjusted.,adjusted,pitch,DYNAMIC
"Depending on the type of pipes, the drones may lie over the shoulder, across the arm opposite the bag,",Depending,,STATIVE
or may run parallel to the chanter.,run,drones,STATIVE
"Some drones have a tuning screw,",have,drones,STATIVE
"which effectively alters the length of the drone by opening a hole,",alters,screw,DYNAMIC
allowing the drone to be tuned to two or more distinct pitches.,allowing,screw,STATIVE
The tuning screw may also shut off the drone altogether.,shut,screw,DYNAMIC
"In most types of pipes, where there is one drone it is pitched two octaves below the tonic of the chanter.",pitched,it,STATIVE
Additional drones often add the octave below and then a drone consonant with the fifth of the chanter.,add,drones,DYNAMIC
