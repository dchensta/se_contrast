Human rights can be classified and organized in a number of different ways.,classified,Classification,DYNAMIC

Civil and political rights are enshrined in articles 3 to 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,enshrined,rights,STATIVE
(UDHR) and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Economic, social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles 22 to 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights",enshrined,rights,STATIVE

===Indivisibility===,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"The UDHR included both economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights",included,Indivisibility,STATIVE
because it was based on the principle,based,it,STATIVE
that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination:,exist,rights,STATIVE
This is held to be true,held,This,STATIVE
"because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights.",assert,public,DYNAMIC
"Similarly, without livelihoods and a working society, the public cannot assert or make use of civil or political rights",assert,public,DYNAMIC
(known as the full belly thesis).,known,assert,STATIVE
The indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights has been confirmed by the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action:,confirmed,interdependence,DYNAMIC
This statement was again endorsed at the 2005 World Summit in New York (paragraph 121).,endorsed,statement,DYNAMIC
"Although accepted by the signatories to the UDHR, most do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights.",give,most,DYNAMIC
"Some Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the right to work, to education, health and housing.",given,cultures,DYNAMIC
"Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights,",tended,countries,STATIVE
but have often failed to provide civil and political rights.,failed,countries,DYNAMIC
===Categorization===,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
Opponents of the indivisibility of human rights argue,argue,=,DYNAMIC
"that economic, social and cultural rights are fundamentally different from civil and political rights",are,rights,STATIVE
and require completely different approaches.,require,rights,STATIVE

that there is no consensus on what should and shouldn't be provided as a right,,,STATIVE

being required only to prevent the breach of rights),,,STATIVE

"* resource-intensive, meaning",,,STATIVE
that they are expensive and difficult to provide,,,STATIVE
"* socialist, as opposed to capitalist",,,STATIVE
"* vague,",,,CANNOT_DECIDE
meaning,,,STATIVE
"they cannot be quantitatively measured,",,,DYNAMIC
and whether they are adequately provided or not is difficult to judge,,,STATIVE
Similarly civil and political rights are categorized as:,,,STATIVE

they can be immediately provided,,,DYNAMIC

===Three generations===,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"Another categorization, offered by Karel Vasak,",offered,categorization,DYNAMIC
is that there are three generations of human rights:,is,categorization,STATIVE
"first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment).",,,CANNOT_DECIDE

and lacks both legal and political recognition.,lacks,generation,STATIVE
"This categorisation is at odds with the indivisibility of rights,",is,categorisation,STATIVE
as it implicitly states,states,it,STATIVE
that some rights can exist without others.,exist,rights,STATIVE
Prioritisation of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity.,is,Prioritisation,STATIVE

==International protection==,,,CANNOT_DECIDE
"In the aftermath of the atrocities of World War II, there was increased concern for the social and legal protection of human rights as fundamental freedoms.",increased,concern,STATIVE
The foundation of the United Nations and the provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for a comprehensive system of international law and practise for the protection of human rights.,provided,foundation,DYNAMIC
